### Cross-Asset Hedging Using Genetic Algorithms

This project aims to develop and optimize cross-asset hedging strategies using genetic algorithms. Cross-asset hedging involves using assets from different classes (e.g., equities, bonds, commodities) to hedge against market risks. Genetic algorithms are used to optimize the weights and selection of hedging assets to minimize risk and maximize returns.

## Introduction

Cross-asset hedging is a strategy that uses multiple asset classes to mitigate risk in a portfolio. By using genetic algorithms, we can find the optimal combination of assets and their weights to achieve the best risk-adjusted returns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- deap (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python)

Methodology
Initialization: Generate an initial population of potential solutions.
Evaluation: Evaluate the fitness of each solution based on risk-adjusted returns.
Selection: Select the best-performing solutions to form a new population.
Crossover: Combine pairs of solutions to create offspring with mixed characteristics.
Mutation: Introduce random changes to some solutions to maintain diversity.
Iteration: Repeat the evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation steps for multiple generations.
