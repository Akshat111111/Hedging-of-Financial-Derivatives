##Introduction
Stress testing is an important risk management tool used to evaluate how a financial portfolio performs under extreme market conditions. This project uses reinforcement learning (RL) to stress test financial portfolios, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities and robustness.

##Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to implement a reinforcement learning agent that can simulate and analyze the impact of various stress scenarios on a financial portfolio. The project involves:

1. Developing an RL environment that simulates financial market conditions.
2. Training an RL agent to apply different stress scenarios to the portfolio.
3. Evaluating the portfolio's performance under these scenarios.
