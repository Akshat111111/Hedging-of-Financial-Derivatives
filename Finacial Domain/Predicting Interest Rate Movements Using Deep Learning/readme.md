# Predicting Interest Rate Movements Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict interest rate movements using deep learning techniques. We will generate a synthetic dataset representing various economic indicators that influence interest rates. After performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data, we will implement three deep learning models: Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to predict interest rates.

## Dataset

The synthetic dataset includes the following features:
- **GDP_Growth**: The annual growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
- **Unemployment_Rate**: The percentage of the total labor force that is unemployed.
- **Inflation_Rate**: The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising.
- **Stock_Index**: The value of a stock market index.
- **Interest_Rate**: The target variable representing the interest rate to be predicted.

The dataset will be generated synthetically for demonstration purposes.
