# Insurance Claim Prediction with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict insurance claims using deep learning algorithms. The system utilizes Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to analyze historical insurance data and predict claim outcomes.

## Objectives

- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess insurance data for model training.
- **Model Development**: Build and train deep learning models (MLP, CNN, RNN) for claim prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance and accuracy.
- **Prediction**: Generate predictions on insurance claims based on model output.

## Models
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
Purpose: Predict the probability of an insurance claim based on features.
Architecture: A fully connected neural network with multiple hidden layers.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Purpose: Applied for feature extraction and pattern detection in structured insurance data.
Architecture: CNN layers for feature extraction, followed by dense layers for prediction.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Purpose: Analyze sequential data and temporal patterns in insurance claims.
Architecture: Includes LSTM or GRU layers to handle sequential dependencies in the data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning frameworks for building and training models.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Additional machine learning tools.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
