# Predicting Commodity Prices Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict commodity prices using deep learning techniques. We will generate a synthetic dataset representing various factors affecting commodity prices and then perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data. We will implement three deep learning models: Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to predict the target commodity price.

## Dataset

The synthetic dataset includes the following features:
- **Stock_Index**: The value of a stock market index.
- **Interest_Rate**: The rate at which interest is paid by borrowers for the use of money.
- **GDP_Growth**: The annual growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
- **Commodity_Price**: The target variable representing the commodity price to be predicted.

The dataset will be generated synthetically for demonstration purposes.
