# Optimal Tax Strategy Development with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing optimal tax strategies using deep learning techniques. The system leverages Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to analyze financial data and optimize tax planning strategies.

## Objectives

- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess financial and tax-related data.
- **Model Development**: Build and train deep learning models (MLP, CNN, RNN) to analyze tax data and develop optimal tax strategies.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance and the effectiveness of the recommended tax strategies.
- **Optimization**: Provide actionable insights and recommendations for tax strategy optimization.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning frameworks for building and training models.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Additional machine learning tools.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
