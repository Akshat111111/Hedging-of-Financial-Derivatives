# Deep Learning for Economic Indicator Forecasting
## Overview
This project aims to forecast economic indicators using deep learning techniques. We will generate a synthetic dataset representing various economic indicators and then perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data. We will implement three deep learning models: Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to predict the target economic indicator.

# Dataset
The synthetic dataset includes the following features:

GDP_Growth: The annual growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Unemployment_Rate: The percentage of the total workforce that is unemployed and actively seeking employment.
Inflation_Rate: The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising.
Interest_Rate: The rate at which interest is paid by borrowers for the use of money.
Stock_Index: The value of a stock market index.
Economic_Indicator: The target variable representing the economic indicator to be forecasted.
The dataset will be generated synthetically for demonstration purposes.
