##Objective
Develop an investment strategy for blockchain and cryptographic assets using Genetic Algorithms (GA).

##Description
This project utilizes Genetic Algorithms to optimize investment strategies for blockchain and cryptographic assets by evolving investment parameters.

Steps
1. Collect and preprocess blockchain and cryptographic asset data.
2. Define investment parameters for optimization.
3. Initialize a population of investment strategies.
4. Evaluate the fitness of each strategy based on historical performance metrics.
5. Select the best-performing strategies.
6. Apply crossover and mutation to generate new strategies.
7. Repeat the process for a defined number of generations.
## Requirements
Python
NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib

##Usage
1. Collect and preprocess blockchain and cryptographic asset data.
2. Define the investment parameters and GA settings.
3. Run the genetic algorithm to optimize the investment strategy.
4. Evaluate the performance of the optimized strategy on a test dataset.
