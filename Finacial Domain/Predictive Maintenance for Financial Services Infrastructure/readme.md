# Predictive Maintenance for Financial Services Infrastructure with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance system for financial services infrastructure using deep learning techniques. The system utilizes Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to forecast potential issues and optimize maintenance schedules for financial infrastructure components.

## Objectives

- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess data related to financial services infrastructure, including operational metrics and maintenance records.
- **Model Development**: Build and train deep learning models (MLP, CNN, RNN) to predict maintenance needs and infrastructure failures.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance in predicting maintenance requirements and reducing downtime.
- **Optimization**: Develop strategies to optimize maintenance schedules and prevent failures.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning frameworks for building and training models.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Additional machine learning tools.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
