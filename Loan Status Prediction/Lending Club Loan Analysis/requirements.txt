## Lending Club Loan Analysis
# Goal
The goal is to create a Machine Learning Model which will Analyse or predict Landing Club Loan  with an accuracy of 79%
## Dataset
The dataset is collected from the following link,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club
## Description
This dataset contains the full LendingClub data available from their site. There are separate files for accepted and rejected loans. The accepted loans also include the FICO scores, which can only be downloaded when you are signed in to LendingClub and download the data.The task is to Analyse and Predict Lending Club Loan Analysis.
