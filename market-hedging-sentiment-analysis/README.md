# Market Hedging Sentiment Analysis Project

This project performs sentiment analysis on various datasets collected from sources like Twitter, Reddit, and financial news headlines. The goal is to analyze sentiment in text data and gain insights into public opinions and emotions on different topics.

## Overview

The project applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and uses machine learning algorithms, including a bidirectional LSTM model, for sentiment analysis. The achieved accuracy of the sentiment analysis model is 94.31%.

## Usage

To use the datasets for sentiment analysis:
1. Load the desired dataset into your preferred data analysis tool or programming environment.
2. Preprocess the text data as needed (e.g., cleaning, tokenization).
3. Apply sentiment analysis techniques (e.g., machine learning algorithms) to analyze sentiment.
4. Visualize the results to gain insights into sentiment trends and patterns.

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding more datasets, improving analysis techniques, or providing feedback on existing code and documentation.
