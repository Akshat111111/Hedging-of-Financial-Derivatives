## **Startup Profit Prediction**
**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to analyze and predict the profit of a startup using features such as 'R&D Spend', 'Administration', 'Marketing Spend', 'State', etc. By leveraging multiple regression techniques, this project aims to identify the most significant factors influencing startup profitability and build a robust predictive model.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Preparation
- Step 3: Data Training
- Step 4: Model Creation
- Step 5: Performance Check


**MODELS USED**
-  Linear Regression
-  Lasso Regression
-  Ridge Regression

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn (For data training, importing models and performance check)

**Accuracy of different models used**
- By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  94.87
 ``` 
 - By using Lasso Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  94.87
 ``` 
  - By using Ridge Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  94.87
 ```

**CONCLUSION**

* All 3 regression algorithms used in this project are equally efficient for the given dataset.
* RMSE for Ridge Regression is least
