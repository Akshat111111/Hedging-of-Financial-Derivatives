# Netflix Stock Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the stock prices of Netflix using various machine learning techniques. Historical stock data is utilized to train models that can forecast future stock prices.

## Introduction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting Netflix stock prices using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop models that can effectively forecast stock prices based on historical data.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Contains historical stock data used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Stores trained machine learning models.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, instructions, and documentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes historical stock prices of Netflix. It consists of daily closing prices, trading volumes, and other relevant financial indicators.

## Models Used

Various machine learning models are explored for stock prediction, including:
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

Each model is evaluated based on its performance metrics and suitability for the stock prediction task.

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using metrics such as:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (RÂ²) score

These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and performance of the models in predicting Netflix stock prices.
