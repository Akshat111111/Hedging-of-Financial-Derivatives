Toyota Chief Says ‘Silent Majority’ Has Doubts About Pursuing Only EVs,48,zpgxoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zpgxoj/toyota_chief_says_silent_majority_has_doubts/,21,1671421269.0,"BURIRAM, Thailand—Toyota Motor Corp. TM -0.87%decrease; red down pointing triangle President Akio Toyoda said he is among the auto industry’s silent majority in questioning whether electric vehicles should be pursued exclusively, comments that reflect a growing uneasiness about how quickly car companies can transition.

Auto makers are making big bets on fully electric vehicles, investments that have been bolstered by robust demand for the limited numbers of models that are now available.

Still, challenges are mounting—particularly in securing parts and raw materials for batteries—and concerns have emerged in some pockets of the car business about the speed to which buyers will make the shift, especially as EV prices have soared this year.

“People involved in the auto industry are largely a silent majority,” Mr. Toyoda said to reporters during a visit to Thailand. “That silent majority is wondering whether EVs are really OK to have as a single option. But they think it’s the trend so they can’t speak out loudly.”

While major rivals, including General Motors Co. and Honda Motor Co., have set dates for when their lineups will be all-EV, Toyota has stuck to a strategy of investing in a diverse lineup of vehicles that includes hydrogen-powered cars and hybrids, which combine batteries with gas engines.

The world’s biggest auto maker has said it sees hybrids, a technology it invented with the debut of the Toyota Prius in the 1990s, as an important option when EVs remain expensive and charging infrastructure is still being built out in many parts of the world. It is also developing zero-emission vehicles powered by hydrogen.

“Because the right answer is still unclear, we shouldn’t limit ourselves to just one option,” Mr. Toyoda said. Over the past few years, Mr. Toyoda said, he has tried to convey this point to industry stakeholders, including government officials—an effort he described as tiring at times.

Global car companies have made a sharp pivot to electric vehicles within the last few years, driven in part by the success of EV-only maker Tesla Inc.

Traditional auto makers such as Toyota, Ford and GM are also facing new competition from startups such as Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group Inc., which make EVs exclusively and have captivated Wall Street in recent years.

At the same time, the legacy auto makers have a much broader base of customers, including many living in rural areas and developing economies with unreliable electricity supplies.

And their gas-engine businesses are still driving the bulk of profits needed to fund the costly shift to electric vehicles, which not only requires the development of new models but also construction of new facilities and battery plants.

The infrastructure to charge electric vehicles is meanwhile still lacking in the U.S. and many other parts of the world, making owning an EV still a challenge for many types of consumers.

According to J.D. Power, the market share for EVs in the U.S. has risen sharply in the last couple of years. As of October, it was around 6.5% of the total new-car market, the firm said.

But that is largely because EV sales are growing faster in places such as California, where there are more options and a greater willingness among buyers to make the shift, J.D. Power analysts say. Sticker prices for electric vehicles have also jumped this year because of the rising cost of battery materials, limiting the pool of buyers who can afford one.

Auto executives say the uptake on EVs could be uneven for some time, and that gas-powered models, along with hybrids and plug-in hybrids, will endure for many years to come.

“The coastal areas, the East and West Coast, that’s electrifying much quicker than the interior of the country,” said Jim Rowan, chief executive of Sweden’s Volvo Car AB. Mr. Rowan said plug-in hybrids serve the purpose of providing buyers with an option if they aren’t ready to go full electric and are important to warming them up to the technology.

Ryan Gremore, an Illinois-based dealer, who owns several brand franchises, said he gets a lot of customers inquiring about EVs, in part because of limited supplies.

That might give the impression of robust demand, but it is unclear how it will materialize when inventory levels at dealerships normalize, he added. “Is there interest in electric vehicles? Yes. Is it more than 10% to 15% of our customer base? No way,” Mr. Gremore said.

Mr. Toyoda’s long-held skepticism about a fully electric future has been shared by others in the Japanese car industry, as well.

Mazda Motor Corp. executives once cautioned that whether EVs were cleaner depends largely on where the electricity is produced. They also worried that EV batteries were too big and expensive to replace gas-powered models and better suited to the types of smaller vehicles that Americans didn’t want.

Nissan Motor Co., which launched the all-electric Leaf over a decade ago, had until recently taken a more cautious stance on EVs with executives saying they were waiting to see how the demand would materialize.

Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said the company moved too aggressively with the Leaf early on, but lately demand for EVs has been growing faster than many had initially expected. Nissan said last year it would spend roughly $14.7 billion to roll out new battery-powered models. Now, Mr. Uchida said it may need to spend more.

The wild card, he said, is regulations and government subsidies globally that could speed adoption even more. “Would that be enough? The answer is it may not be,” Mr. Uchida said.

Mr. Toyoda has argued that fully electric models aren’t the only way to reduce carbon emissions, saying hybrid vehicles sold in large volumes can also deliver a short-term impact. “It’s about what can be done now,” he said.

Mr. Toyoda’s cautionary tone toward EVs has caused some concern from investors and consumers that the auto maker could be falling behind in the EV race.

Toyota has been slower than rivals to roll out fully electric models in major markets such as the U.S., with its bZ4X electric SUV being recalled earlier this year because of a potential safety problem.

Mr. Toyoda said the auto maker was taking all types of vehicles seriously, including EVs. In late 2021, it revealed plans to spend up to $35 billion on its EV lineup through 2030. Since then, Toyota has disclosed sizable investments in EV manufacturing capacity in the U.S.

The Toyota chief also said alternatives to EVs, such as hydrogen-powered vehicles, were beginning to get a warmer reception from government officials, members of the media and others involved in the auto industry.

“Two years ago, I was the only person making these kinds of statements,” Mr. Toyoda said.

WSJ: Retail/small investors dive into markets as institutional ones grow more bearish,5,zpgvhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zpgvhy/wsj_retailsmall_investors_dive_into_markets_as/,4,1671421092.0,"During the wildest year for global markets since 2008, individual investors have been doubling down on stocks. Many professionals, on the other hand, appear to have bailed out.  

U.S. equity mutual and exchange-traded funds, which are popular among individual investors, have attracted more than $100 billion in net inflows this year, one of the highest amounts on record in EPFR data going back to 2000. 

Hedge funds, meanwhile, have been paring how much risk they are taking in stocks or making outright bets that major U.S. indexes will tumble. Mutual funds have increased their cash positions to about 2.5% of their portfolios this fall, up from around 1.5% at the end of last year and the highest level since early 2020, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Ben Snider, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said institutional and individual investors often dump stocks in tandem when the economy is slowing and indexes are tumbling. That doesn’t appear to have happened this year, despite the S&P 500’s decline.

“The fact that you have not seen very much selling from households is surprising,” Mr. Snider said. 

U.S. households typically sell about $10 billion in stocks after the S&P 500 falls at least 10% from its peak. Investors yanked money from stock funds in 2015 and 2018, the last times the index suffered annual losses, EPFR data show. 

The S&P 500 is on pace for its worst year in more than a decade, marked by volatility that continued last week when the Federal Reserve and central banks around the globe kept raising interest rates.

In the coming days, fresh data on housing and consumer spending will provide more clues on the health of U.S. consumers and how the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases are rippling through the economy.

Brian Wilkinson, 60 years old, said he has seen worse in the markets. He witnessed the 1987 stock-market crash, remained invested after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and rode out the 2008 financial crisis. The market always bounced back. 

With inflation high, he still thinks he has a better shot at earning high returns from stocks than bonds.  

Never a big spender on such things as eating out or entertainment, Mr. Wilkinson has continued contributing cash to his church and stashing away money toward retirement funds. This year, he increased his exposure to stocks to roughly 70% of his portfolio. Paying down the mortgage on his home has given Mr. Wilkinson, who lives near Nashville, Tenn., extra firepower to keep investing. 

“Stocks are really the only game in town to ultimately beat inflation,” Mr. Wilkinson said. 

Still, watching his investments tumble has been trying. 

“It’s painful,” Mr. Wilkinson said. But “it’s the mistakes people make in the downturns that hurt people the most.” 

Consumers’ resilience has been a buffer of support for the market this year. Despite worries about a recession, the jobs market remains robust and wages have kept ticking higher. Of course, there are signs that trend is turning. Retail sales in November posted their biggest drop in nearly a year, showing that people are spending less on everything from electronics to books.

And the Fed has indicated it isn’t done raising rates. 

That is one reason for the pessimism among many institutional investors. Net bearish positions tied to stock futures hit a record high over the summer, according to Deutsche Bank data, a sign that asset managers and hedge funds were bracing for stocks to keep tumbling. Many of those investors appear to have reduced their bearish positions lately, although as of early December, they were far from bullish.

Meanwhile, one measure of how exposed hedge funds are to the stock market—the share of their positions invested in bullish stock positions versus bearish—has fallen to the lowest level since early 2019 among funds tracked by Goldman. 

In a note in early December, Amy Wu Silverman, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets, said her clients, which include hedge funds and asset managers, were “quite bearish.”

In one sign of how reluctant many are to make bold stock bets, even knowing others across Wall Street were bearish wasn’t enough to entice some to take a contrarian, bullish stance, she said.

That is why some strategists say a big rally through the end of the year would see many institutional investors wrong-footed.

Some were caught off guard in 2020, for example. Stock futures positioning among asset managers and leveraged funds hit a low around mid-June, and the S&P 500 went on to rally about 8% over the next two months and roughly 20% through the end of the year. 

For many individuals, such a rally would be welcome after they waded in to buy the dip in stocks for much of the year, only to see shares fall further. The buy-the-dip trade, which rewarded investors handsomely in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, is on pace for its worst year since 1979, with stocks falling around 0.7% the week after a 1% decline, according to Dow Jones Market Data. 

George Feygin, a lawyer based in Peachtree City, Ga., said he hasn’t changed his strategy this year and has kept adding to his investment accounts each month. In June, he put a chunk of his bonus into a fund tracking the S&P 500. 

“I’m buying low, hopefully,” he said.

As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ Visa at its core is a payment processor. Visa connects the buyer and seller while a financial partner provides the cash in to facilitate the transaction. These partners are paid the value of rewards (client incentives) to hold in escrow to pay to end users of their cards.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ They earn revenue by facilitating payments between customers and merchants, data processing revenues to facilitate clearing and settlement, International transactions allow them to earn fees to enable cross-currency transaction and finally other revenues which is mainly licensing fees. Together, the above makes up gross revenue.

§ Their cards are used daily and are broken down between debit and credit transactions. Credit Cards are typically co-branded and affiliated with a bank (that provides the funds) and a company (which sets the terms of the awards). Debit cards are connected directly with a financial institution and allow you to pay directly from your account without providing your bank account number.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ No, they have $0.65 cents of debt for every $1.00 of equity and operate with an extremely high interest coverage ratio of 36x.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, while revenues will rise and fall with the economy, there cards will be used continuously. They have access to $950 million of commercial paper with no balance outstanding.

§ Visa also operates with a negative cash conversion cycle. This is in part enabled by collecting fees when they occur but pay rewards over time. This is tracked by capitalizing their rewards and making periodic payments.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ For sure. There are only 4 players in the credit card market: Visa, MasterCard, AMEX and Discovery. Visa has been in the payment space for over 60 years. Despite technological changes, they continue to remain at the center of the payment industry for reasons will describe below.

o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes. FCF margins have averaged a staggering 55.5% over the past 5 years, returns on assets over 15% over the past 5 years, steady revenue growth. Their financials are the envy of most of the world.

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ The advantage is to replace Visa, you need to find a method to have customers want to use your new payment system and need to have merchants who accept the payment method. Additionally, Visa wisely pays incentives for using their cards. This adds a further barrier as you would omit a benefit by not using their card. Given their unprecedented scale they can leverage their extremely low operating costs over a massive revenue base enabling these massive margins. A smaller player would not have this level of scale and would need to burn a significant amount of capital to scale. Take new players of late. Venmo was able to get users and replaced sending your friends cash or checks but has had a difficult time being accepted by merchants for fees. Apple and Android pay brought their massive consumer lists to the digital world, but still rely on the cards as they don’t have the merchants nor do the programs offer rewards (outside of credit cards).

§ Additionally, Visa has no fear that it won’t be accepted. You know it is accepted virtually anywhere. Most consumers would not want the headache of a new payment system given the current system works so well.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ I don’t believe so. Their advantage is not so much based on allocating capital for a long time. It’s a brand of trusted secure payments with a well-entrenched network effect.

§ I think it will be extremely difficult for a new player to get merchants, customers and fund an incentive for using their new payment system.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ The network effect for payments.

o Are there competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Yes, this history of payments overall is a story not for the faint of heart for most players. New technologies are always trying to enter the mix. Whether its crypto, Venmo or Cash App or whatever other new methods come down the pike there will always be threats to this market.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, Visa has grown revenues at 10% per year with stable fat margins. Cash still represents 20% of all transactions across the globe. This number will likely continue to dwindle over time giving Visa a nice tailwind to grow in excess of worldwide GDP growth +/- currency changes.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

§ I believe so.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ I feel it would be extremely difficult to kill.

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Revenue FYE 09/30/22 was $29.310 billion for 2022

§ Revenue is forecast to be $39.451 billion for FYE 25

§ Revenue is forecast to $54.61 billion for FY 28

§ That is a 3-year revenue CAGR of 10.41% from 22 to 25

§ That is a 3-year revenue CAGR of 11.49% from 25 to 28

§ Shares have decreased by 1.5% and 1.9% per year over the past 3 and 5 years respectively. Most of these buybacks accrued with FCF yields of 3%. Since current FCF yield is slightly above this average, I feel it is fair to project that shares decrease a slightly more optimistic range of 1.5% to 2.25% per year.

§ With current shares outstanding of 1.883 billion, this suggests shares outstanding are estimated be 1.75 to 1.80 billion shares on 09/30/25.

§ Current dividend policy is $0.45 per quarter or $1.80 per share. Let’s hold that going forward. Having said that it will likely rise over the next 2 years.

§ Levered FCF margins are fairly stable. Lets assume 50% to 60% and I will use a 10% discount and premium to the estimated revenue with the low and high margins

§ Putting it all together you get a FCF per share of $9.86 to $14.88 on 09/30/25.

§ FCF Yields have averaged 3.2% over the past 5 years. Given the companies entrenchment and some cyclicality and that 3 years after 2025 its current expectations are to maintain a 10+% growth rate, a 3.5% to 4.5% FCF yield is fair in my view.

§ To value the company, I assumed the high FCF per share will be associated with higher yields and lower FCF per share will be paired with lower yield. This gives a range of value per share on 09/30/2025 of $281.79 to $330.64.

§ Currently shares are selling for $207 which implies a 15.6% annual return at the midpoint.

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ I believe so, a company with the risk characterized in Visa in my view should be selling at a price that would yield the same as the market, call it 10%. That implies a price of $239 per share given my expectations.

§ Given my expectations, Visa seems to be modestly undervalued

Trading through volatile times .. 2023,42,zp3eiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zp3eiu/trading_through_volatile_times_2023/,49,1671383914.0,"I had a new thought last night that of course during upcoming turbulent markets when you expect that things may get bad its better to go maybe 80% cash and then trade with 10 to 20%.

Basically half the battle in investing is preserving what you already have and not necessarily going for huge gains, especially in crappy times.

Yes, you may miss out on rallies if you're 80% cash, but I don't see any new sustained bull markets happening any time soon!

So my idea is this.

Maybe 80% cash in money market where it's totally liquid.

Then I play my hand and gamble with very small amounts to very slowly add to my existing balance.

Yes, adding $500 here and there is not much but I'm also preserving 80% of my hard earned money while others may lose 40% if the sp500 sells off in the upcoming months.

My method is something like this.

80 to 90% cash in mm.

Then I put 10% or whatever in QQQ.

I wait.

As soon as I gain $500 or so I sell and am patient again and wait for a sizeable drop. Maybe 5 to 10%.

Then I reenter and do it again.

This could also be done with a stock like aapl or unh or something.

This way I'm gambling with only 10% of my money and preserving 90% through a very volatile period that most see in 2023s first half at least.

Either that or I just hold the (QQQ) with 10% and add little by little on large dips.

So I'm effectively preserving my 90% (Maybe that's a bit high!ĺ) and then only 10% is ""sloshing around"".

If we go down 30% eventually ( by February or March 2023) then I move more into QQQ . Maybe 20% more or something.

Ride it up and then trim a little if we get back to present levels?

Just an idea.",2022-12-18 19:18:34

Meta Just Issued a Status Update. Wall Street Should Read Into It.
Instagram’s new retro look could signal revenue woes at its parent

Laura Forman
Dec. 17, 2022 at 10:00 am ET

Meta‘s push of its short-form video platform Reels, a TikTok copycat, angered some high-profile users, causing Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner to advocate for making “Instagram Instagram again.” With its new features, Meta seems focused on engaging people back on older surfaces such as Messages and Stories. As of the third quarter, Meta said more social interactions were already moving to messaging.

Data hint at why: Internal company dashboards viewed by The Wall Street Journal show growth in U.S. monthly active people on Instagram has moderated this year after growing strongly for years. In the U.S., story posts on Instagram appear to have declined in recent months, and overall comments on the app have been declining over the past two years. Time spent on the app, though, seems to have increased over that period.

The prominence of Reels, launched on Instagram in mid-2020, likely explains these trends. **Indeed, on its third-quarter conference call, Meta noted a 50% increase in Reels played over the previous six months across Facebook and Instagram daily. That hasn’t turned into revenue growth. Meta said on its third-quarter call that, as Reels’ popularity grows, the platform displaces areas they are better able to monetize. Specifically, Meta said it is suffering “more than a $500 million quarterly revenue headwind” with the shift.**

The hit comes at a bad time. Since Meta grew sales over 50% in the second quarter of 2021 from a year earlier, business has slumped. Wall Street is forecasting the company will end the year with its third straight quarter of annual sales declines. The result has been a 64% drop in its stock price this year, erasing some $600 billion in market value.

**(Re)enter the status update—likely a strategic move to get people back on more lucrative areas of the app before the end of the year.**

Instagram’s homage to BeReal, meanwhile, is sending its own message. Despite its sudden popularity this year, the app has garnered limited interest. Roughly three years after its launch, BeReal has racked up just 53 million worldwide downloads, according to an October Sensor Tower report, and only 9% of Android users with the app actively installed were opening it daily. To Instagram, an app with some 2 billion users, BeReal can hardly be viewed as a real threat.

Meta’s move seems to say more about the company’s reluctance to spend on truly unique content to reignite ad growth as it is deploying billions of dollars toward its metaverse ambitions and having to lay off 13% of its staff. The alternative explanation isn’t much more encouraging: Perhaps after decades of evolution, creatives in the sector are finding themselves tapped out.

The good news is that, amid a broader advertising slowdown, Wall Street’s bar for Meta this quarter looks low. Analysts are forecasting the company’s revenue will fall 6.5% in the period from a year earlier—its sharpest quarterly decline as a public company. AB Bernstein’s recent channel checks give some reason for hope, though. Its research showed that, while advertisers are diversifying into TikTok and retail media ads such as those on Amazon, Meta “still accounts for the lion’s share of display ad spend,” adding that spending into next year will likely grow across all channels. Data from Similarweb show Instagram may be a particular beneficiary of Twitter’s loss of ad spending in recent months as well.

Even so, Meta’s status still looks a little tired.",2022-12-18 19:13:43
AirBNB (ABNB) Stock Review 12/18/22,246,zp0xf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zp0xf6/airbnb_abnb_stock_review_121822/,121,1671376875.0," 

As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ ABNB connects over 1 billion customers with its network of over 4 million hosts. Hosts develop a unique space all around the world for customers to stay. They are homes, cabins, castles, yurts, boats, villas and more. AirBNB also offers many hosting services.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ AirBNB earns service fees. These are effectively commissions for connecting a customer with a host. AirBNB books are somewhat cyclical and seasonal. There bookings are correlated with the economy. AirBNB also receives the cash upfront when a property is booked and recognizes that revenue when the customer has checked in to their property.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Very little. They operate with $.43 of debt for every dollar of equity on their balance sheet. Additionally, their interest coverage is a massive 77x. Usually AAA rated names need to be over 20x (among other factors).

§ They ended the 3rd quarter with $7.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and have access to an additional $1.0 billion line of credit.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Given their conservative balance sheet I would say they are well suited given the cyclical nature of their industry. They have about 6 quarters worth of expenses of liquidity for a business that is cash flow positive currently.

§ Additionally, since cash is collected before the stay, they are able to operate with a negative cash conversion cycle meaning they get the benefit of cash for some time prior to paying expenses. While this would slow in a downturn, this does suggest a strong financial position.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ Some. Connecting hosts and customers is not a difficult business to replicate on the surface. For example after AirBNB paved the way, new competitors joined the rank like VRBO, HomeAway and even Expedia is starting to book Airbnbs. Having said that, given AirBNB’s size, they are still the clear leader for this space.

o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes, this post covid travel boom has been a godsend to their business and FCF margins have grown to an all-time high of 40%. The previous highwater mark was 14% in 2018. Additional scale has been showcases as revenue per employee has moved up to $1.31 million and returns on assets have steadily climbed to 11%.

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ The competitive advantage is that hosts want to list where customers search, and customers want to search where hosts list. This creates a network effect. Additionally, this network effect is bolstered by host support agencies want to list on AirBNB to showcase their services due to the plethora of hosts. Finally with their scale and margins, I feel they will be able to out invest competitors in new solutions to cement their advantage while still having strong financials.

§ They also have brand strength given AirBNB is not only the company name, but it is what people call this kind of vacation.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ As this industry has and continues to mature, I feel you would be hard pressed to start from scratch given the dynamic of the network effect I mentioned above.

§ Having said that, we will likely see consolidation of hosts over time giving then more bargaining power. For example, should a host buyout/merge with 1000 other Airbnb properties they might be able to host a site strong enough to list the sites themselves and bypass AirBNB all together. This is a much more capital-intensive model and would likely take significant time. Were basically talking about going full circle here and ending up with a hotel chain of different locations ironically.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ The Brand. Its difficult to get to the point of Kleenex, Google it and AirBNB it. Being the first mover in this industry likely will give them a long runway.

o Are there competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Yes, smaller hosting sites and as I mentioned host consolidation and therefore increasing their bargaining power.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ I would say yes. AirBNB’s fastest segment is long term rentals as fully digital employees opt to hop around month to month. While there will likely be some pull in for work from home, I don’t think the trend will be eliminated.

§ They are at that sweet spot too where they are likely small enough to growth through a recession but are large enough to be profitable.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, while AirBNB is fairly mature in the US, they are fairly small abroad giving them a long run way for many years.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

§ I believe I do.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Yes, I think their conservative balance sheet and network effect will keep them well insulated from competition over the coming years.

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Revenue for 12/31/22 is forecasted at \~$8.3 billion

§ Revenue for 12/31/25 is forecasted at \~$12.645 billion

§ Revenue for 12/31/28 is forecasted at \~$17.644 billion

§ This implies a 3-year revenue CAGR from 22 to 25 of 15% per year

§ This also implies a 3-year revenue CAGR from 25 to 28 of 12% per year

§ YTD Shares have an annualized growth rate of 2.84% per year

§ Since going public shares have increased by 4.39% per year

§ Going forward, given the wider margins and higher revenue per employee I would expect less total dilution per year. Given this is hard to project, I am going to assume 0 to 2.5% per year

§ As of 10/14/22 they have 642,377,183 shares outstanding. By 12/31/25 they would be expected to have 642.37 million to 693.908 million shares.

§ In terms of FCF margins this is also difficult to predict given the small data set and covid period both during and after. We are likely at peak margins which are trending as high as 40%. It appears the lows have been around 20%. I am going to assume margin ranges between 25% to 35% for a midpoint of 30% to reflect higher overall margins from scale, but acknowledge we are likely at a peak.

§ In terms of FCF yield, in 2025 projects today say 3 years from then the company is expected to grow at 12% per year. Given the variability in their revenues from the economy, I feel that a FCF yield of 4% to 8% is probably appropriate. This is in-line with Expedia’s FCF yield prior to 2020

§ Estimated FCF per share in 2025 4.55 (12.645 rev \* 25% margin / 693 shares) to 6.89 (12.645 Rev \* 35% margin / 642.37 shares)

§ With a FCF yield of 8% on the low FCF per share and a 4% yield on the high FCF per share we get a 3-year valuation between $56.88 to $172.25 for a midpoint of $114.56

§ With a current price of $89.57 this implies a 3 year CAGR of -13.50% to 23.28% per year with a midpoint of 8.19% per year.

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ Its probably a little elevated. A price of $80 would imply a 12% return on the midpoint. Given the cyclicality of the company, that is probably a fair price given the current expectations.

§ With a minimal public track record, this is a very difficult company to value hence the wide range in outcomes.

First ever DCF on GOOG. Need some Advice and Criticism on my thought processes when forecasting.,11,zotc2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zotc2o/first_ever_dcf_on_goog_need_some_advice_and/,12,1671350221.0,"Spreadsheet: [https://imgur.com/a/TLkzWt8](https://imgur.com/a/TLkzWt8)Revenue forecasting: [https://imgur.com/a/jHtuSgp](https://imgur.com/a/jHtuSgp)

Revenue:

Revenue mainly comes from Advertising, Cloud and Others and can be reliably forecasted. For simplicity sake, the first paragraph of each year will be %of revenue from Advertising, Cloud and Others. Second paragraph of each year will be Y/Y growth from Advertising, Cloud and Others.

**Cloud:**  
**2022:**  
% forecast: Due to covid, businesses were pushed to go digital so firms are more receptive to automation so Cloud is likely to take up a larger portion of revenue over time.  


Y/Y forecast: The average of 2020 - 2021 is taken when forecasting Y/Y cloud 2022 as these took into account the effects of covid, however a limitation recognised here would be that in 2022 high inflation led to high interest rates so Y/Y growth may not be so high.  


**2023 - 2024:**  
**%** forecast: I forecast that cloud will start taking up a larger percentage of revenue as the Fed do expect interest rates to come down by end of 2024 when interest rates fall businesses are likely to be able to invest in the business and automate.

Y/Y forecast: Due to a lack of industry knowledge I’m going to be conservative and assume a slightly higher than historic growth rate of 2% Y/Y per year from 2023 to 2024.

**2025 - 2026:%** forecast: I estimate cloud will probably peak at about 15% due to tougher competitions from AWS and market saturation.

Y/Y forecast: Due to the full effects of falling interest rates finally showing up due to the lag in policy in 2025, Y/Y increase is going to spike higher than past forecasted years.

**2027 - 2030:%** forecast: I estimate that cloud will probably plateau at about 13.5% onwards.

Y/Y forecast:  Revenue is plateaued to 47% as a conservative estimate

**Advertising:**

**2022:**% forecast: Advertising is going to decrease in terms of % of revenue due to decrease in retail spending and tougher inflation environment.

Y/Y forecast: To prevent Y/Y growth from being skewed by 2020 Covid, I only took the average of 2018-2019 where advertisers had the confidence of spending on advertisement without taking covid into consideration.

**2023 - 2025:**% forecast: Advertising is going to decrease in 2023 and 2024 due to high interest rates and uncertain environment for investors. A conservative 1% was used in decline as advertising is still GOOG’s core operations.

Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth is assumed to be more conservative as advertising is a matured business of GOOG. But 2025 Y/Y growth will be higher due to lower interest rates.

**2026 - 2030:**% forecast: GOOG is likely to continue being a strong seller of advertisements and their expansion into different modal for google searches is likely to keep their advertisement revenue high.Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth is harder to forecast due to uncertainty in interest rates policy from 2025 onwards.**Others:**% forecast: I’m uncertain of how exactly to accurately depict others but it is not something that GOOG focuses on especially when you listen to their past few earnings calls. So % I’ll just use others to top up till 100%

Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth I’ll assume plateaus at about 18% due to strong competition from Apple.

&#x200B;

**EBIT:**

The average of 2020 and 2021 were taken when forecasting 2022 as 2020 was when there were high layoffs due to covid uncertainty and 2021 was when there was low interest rates that allowed companies to reinvest more than usual.

GOOG is still reinvesting large sums back into cloud so EBIT is taken to decrease till 23% with reference to 2018 and 2019 where it seemed like a steady margin and the most efficiently run GOOG was.To be conservative I’ll just assume EBIT goes to 20% by the end of my forecast period.

**Taxes:**

Due to GOOG being high in R&D I’d assume Taxes hold steady at 20% throughout my forecast.

**D&A:**

Assumed to be at 7% throughout

**Deferred Taxes:**

Being a relatively small line item, I assume that deferred taxes are going to get smaller as GOOG would probably know how to value their PP&E properly as more time goes on. But since it is a small line item, I just put it at a constant 1% to avoid over or undercompensating for it,

**Change in NWC:**

Assumed to be at 1% throughout

**CapEX:**

I assume GOOG is going to ramp up CapEX going into 2025 due to interest rates expected to be lowered by then. But over time as Cloud becomes matured I don’t see CapEX taking up a large portion so I tend it towards 10% just above D&A

**WACC:**

COE, GOOG does not pay dividend yield so most of COE comes from average % price increase in its stock.I’d assume GOOG has a market beta of the average between 1.25 and 1.06  based on [https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\~adamodar/New\_Home\_Page/datafile/Betas.html](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/Betas.html) GOOG is classified under information services? And [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)Risk free rate at the time of 2021 was about 2%.

Risk premium was 5.5% based on [https://www.statista.com/statistics/664840/average-market-risk-premium-usa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/664840/average-market-risk-premium-usa/)

COE = 8.35%

COD, GOOG’s bond yield was taken into consideration for this.

[https://cbonds.com/bonds/55087/#:\~:text=International%20bonds%3A%20Google%2C%203.625%25%2019may2021%2C%20USD%20(US38259PAB85)](https://cbonds.com/bonds/55087/#:~:text=International%20bonds%3A%20Google%2C%203.625%25%2019may2021%2C%20USD%20(US38259PAB85))

COD = 3.625%

%Equity = 100% - 30.37% = 69.62%%Liability = 97072/319 616 = 30.37%Tax Rate = 19% based on 2021’s Taxes

📷

Extract from GOOG’s 2021 10-K

Total WACC = 69.62% x 8.35% + 30.37% x 3.625% x (1 - 19%) = 6.71%

TGR = 2.5%

some very specific questions I have:

1. Is my Tax forecast by holding it at 20% unrealistic?
2. Is it okay to keep depreciation constant at 7% of sales?
3. Unsure of how exactly to accurately depict change in NWC?
4. Was there a better way of finding out WACC for GOOG?",2022-12-18 09:57:01
Service Corporation International (SCI) Stock Review,13,zoo9zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zoo9zf/service_corporation_international_sci_stock_review/,5,1671332511.0,"As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions. 

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ SCI is the leading provider of deathcare services. They operate 1,471 funeral service locations and 488 cemeteries across 44 states, 8 Canadian provinces, DC and Puerto Rico. They operate under Dignity Memorial, Dignity Planning, National Cremation Society, Advantage Funeral and Cremation Services, Funeraria Del Angel, Making Everlasting Memories, Neptune Society and Trident Society brands.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ Stable one-off transactions. Terrible business, no repeat customers /s

§ Revenue is collected two ways, pre-need and at-need services. Pre-need would be your prepaid funeral. This allows SCI to collect the premiums up front and invest them in the trust. Upon death the expenses are withdrawn from the trust. At need services are managed like more traditional transactions.

§ The deathcare industry is a little unique, given that they make up \~15% of the deathcare market in the US, they have steady revenues as sadly about 0.83% of the population passes each year.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Yes, SCI has slightly more leverage than I would prefer. They have $2.5 of debt for every $1 of equity and have a fairly low interest coverage of 6.4x. Having said that, they are extremely well entrenched in their market will likely never be obsolete. 

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ A downturn is highly unlikely. Having said that they have $551.3 million of borrowing capacity and have used $325 million for a remainder of 226 million. That is approximately a months’ worth of expenses. That’s kinda tight, but funerals don’t have too many recessions.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ Yes, they were originally formed in 1962 and have only grown from there. Many of their assets like cemeteries and crematoriums are subject to strict regulations and require extensive permitting to establish. Not all regulators will be anxious to add another funeral home to their town/city. Time alone is a test in and of itself and 60 years of operations suggest entrenchment.

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes, SCI consistently earns \~12% free cash flow margins, has grown fairly consistently and had average ROEs annually of 33% per year.

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ Low-Cost Provider. As I mentioned earlier, roughly 0.8% of Americans pass annually. This for specific locations can be fairly lumpy but in aggregate is fairly smooth. SCI leverages their massive footprint and enables their back office operations to be shared across numerous funeral service locations. Through scale alone, you can enable less total staff per funeral as the staff can be used more efficiently across a wider footprint of funerals. 

§ Additionally, SCI has permits in place. In smaller areas this leads to efficient scale. The idea that small regional markets are typically best served by one player and therefore not likely to get additional regulatory approval and granting a small regional advantage.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ I don’t think so. Since they are so large and more profitable than the plethora of mom and pop operators the natural attempt would be for a smaller player to acquire many other players (like they did). Now that SCI has the lowest cost operations, they could rationally pay more than anyone else should a bidding war occur. 

§ To grow organically would likely take to long and be too difficult given how mature this market is.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ I think their entire business is able to be replicated with capital, but it would simply take too long and be too difficult to do given the permits and scale disadvantage of being a smaller player. Long story short, it likely wouldn’t be high returning for a long time for a new entrant.

o Are their competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Threats often come in the form from changes in taste of consumers. Do they want cremations or burials. The largest threat is likely a new-fashioned development of burial practices. For example, I know being buried in the root ball of a tree has come into fashion of late. While these changes can be real and impactful, I don’t think it is the kind of change that nullifies their advantages.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes. Currently 56 million Americans are over 65. By 2030, that amount is expected to rise to 71 million.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, the fastest growing demographic is the over 65 categories.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision? 

§ I feel I do.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Yes

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Revenue 3 years from now is estimated to be $4.239 billion.

§ With an average FCF margin of 12% over the past 5 years, I believe margin will hold around that level meaning FCF is expected to be $500 million. Given investments in automation and additional scale, there is an argument to be made that they may increase.

§ Over the last 3, 5, 7 and 10 years share count has reduced by an average of \~3.0% per year. Let’s assume this continues.

§ Shares Outstanding as of 11/02/2022 are 153,805,512. 12/31/25 would be 3.08 years away. This implies shares outstanding 3.08 years from now would be about 140 million.

§ This means forecasted FCF per share is estimated to be between $3.57 per share.

§ Free cash flow Yields have averaged ranged between 4% and 6% over the past 5 years.

§ If we assume a FCF Yield between 4% to 6% this implies a Dec 2025 price of $59.50 to $89 per share.

§ Current dividend yield is 1.7% or 1.00 per share. Let’s assume $1.00 is received each year 

§ With a current price of $68 this implies a 3-year CAGR between -2.86% to 10.88%

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ No. SCI in my view is too highly rated from the sad surge in passing from Covid and the economic uncertainty causing a flight to safety. I would be a buyer around $55. At that price the expected returns would be between 4.5% to 19%. Having said that, my guess is free cash flow yield will be at the lower end of the range (i.e higher ending price) as the population ages and therefore growth accelerates in the coming years. This may open a price at \~$60.

> 
> While Intel has not made any official announcements about a delay, it said in a statement Saturday that “much has changed” since the company disclosed plans to build in Magdeburg. “Geopolitical challenges have become greater, semiconductor demand has declined, and inflation and recession are disrupting the global economy,” according to the statement.

Verisign (VRSN) Stock Review,31,zojavo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zojavo/verisign_vrsn_stock_review/,8,1671319057.0,"As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

# Verisign (VRSN)

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ VRSN operates 2 of the 13 world’s root servers. Root servers track IP Address with the domain names associated with that IP address. VRSN has been granted a monopoly for .com and .net registrations.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ Recurring. Each year domains must pay to keep their domain associated with its IP address so it can be connected to the internet. These prices are set through ICANN. The current agreement runs through October 2026 and at that point VRSN is allowed to raise prices up 10.26. In January 2020 the price was $7.85. This implies an annual price increase of 4% per year. 

§ Revenue is influenced by 3 factors: New registrations, Retention Rates and pricing.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Yes, VRSN leverages its monopolistic position with a high amount of debt. Currently they operate with more debt than they have assets (negative equity). Having said that their interest coverage is a very reasonable 12x given the steadiness in revenue. While negative equity can indicate a company is insolvent, negative equity here showcases their ability to distribute significant wealth to its shareholders through stock buybacks.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, as of their 3Q report they have a credit line outstanding $200 million with none drawn on it. That represents about a quarter and a half of expenses. Given the low customer concentration, the mission critical nature of their service and the nominal cost for businesses, I am comfortable with this LOC. 

§ Additionally, they operate with a negative cash conversion cycle (take in cash before expenses occur).

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ VRSN has been the backbone of the internet for over 25 years and has contracts in place to 2026. The internet works extremely well, and its fees are nominal. To me this translates into a cemented position. Would it be worth it for a regulator to entertain a competitor that is willing to charge $9 or $8 given things work extremely well? Probably not.

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes VRSN’s financials are the envy of virtually any firm. Their average ROA over the past 5 years is a massive 34% with average FCF margins are 60% over the past 5 years and they have virtually no CAPEX.

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ Regulatory Entrenchment. They have smoothly operated as the backbone of the internet for over 25 years. This gives VRSN a unique understanding of the internet’s operations as they are the only player in the space. I feel that it would not be worth the risk for a regulator to move to a different provider.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ No. Capital is not the issue for this business. Any company could match IP with domain names. What matters here is relationships to get the contract as well as history of strong services, which they have.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ Yes what they actually do is extremely easy, but it is only available to one player. 

o Are their competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Yes, they potentially could be bypassed from blockchains. Blockchain operates outside the DNS system which is used to match IP addresses with domain names. Should the world move on the blockchain, and we start navigating to Google.eth rather than .com or .net they would be cutout as their service would not be needed. This has a minor potential at this point, but is something important to watch for sure.

· **Growth**

o Is their a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes, revenue has grown literally every quarter over at least the last decade with margins pretty steady at 60% over nearly all TTM periods.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Probably not. Over the last 5 years revenue gains have averaged at 3.1% per year despite a covid bump

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision? 

§ I feel I do.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Yes, although growth will be somewhat a challenge

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ They do not pay a dividend.

§ Free cash flow Yields have averaged 3.7% over the past 5 years.

§ Revenue 3 years from now is estimated to be $1.78 billion.

§ With an average FCF margin of 60% over the past 5 years, I believe margin will hold around that level meaning FCF is expected to be $1.068 billion.

§ Over the last 4.25 years shares have been reduced by about 4.25% per year. During this period of buybacks FCF yields ranged between 2.7% and 4.2%. Given that FCF yield is at the higher end of the range I would say they could easily retire 4.2% per year going forward. I will model share buybacks at 3.75% to 4.25% per year

§ Shares Outstanding as of 10/21/22 are 106,016,456. 12/31/25 would be 3.08 years away. This implies shares outstanding 3.08 years from now at 92.74 million and 94.24 million

§ This means forecasted FCF per share is estimated to be between $11.31 and $11.51.

§ If we assume a FCF Yield between 3.5% to 4.5% this implies a Dec 2025 price of $251 to $328.

§ With a current price of $200 this implies a 3-year CAGR between 8.01% to 17.93%

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ Given the historical steadiness of the company and contract through 2026 along with the low-end expectations of an 8.0% annualized return, I feel that this company represents good value at this time given what I feel is a cemented competitive position.

John Carmack leaving META. “… we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort … our organization is operating at half the effectiveness …”,501,zogyrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zogyrh/john_carmack_leaving_meta_we_constantly/,119,1671313020.0,"Virtual Reality Pioneer Is Leaving Meta

John Carmack, who was chief technology officer of Oculus, which Meta bought, is departing the company.

John Carmack, a pioneer of virtual reality technology, is leaving Meta after more than eight years at the company, according to an internal post reviewed by The New York Times.

In the post, which was written by Mr. Carmack, 52, the technologist criticized his employer. He said Meta, which is in the midst of transitioning from a social networking company to one focused on the immersive world of the metaverse, was operating at “half the effectiveness” and has “a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort.”

“It has been a struggle for me,” Mr. Carmack wrote in the post, which was published on an internal forum this week. “I have a voice at the highest levels here, so it feels like I should be able to move things, but I’m evidently not persuasive enough.”

As the former chief technology officer of Oculus, the virtual reality company that Facebook bought for $2 billion in 2014, Mr. Carmack was one of the most influential voices leading the development of V.R. headsets. He stayed with Facebook after Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, decided to shift the company last year to focus on the metaverse and renamed Facebook as Meta.

Yet even though Meta was moving swiftly into an area that Mr. Carmack specialized in, he was sometimes a dissenting voice about how the effort was going. He became known for internal posts that criticized the decision-making and direction set forth by Mr. Zuckerberg and Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer. Mr. Carmack had been working part-time for the company in recent years.

What Is the Metaverse, and Why Does It Matter?


The origins. The word “metaverse” describes a fully realized digital world that exists beyond the one in which we live. It was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel “Snow Crash,” and the concept was further explored by Ernest Cline in his novel “Ready Player One.”

The future. Many people in tech believe the metaverse will herald an era in which our virtual lives will play as important a role as our physical realities. Some experts warn that it could still turn out to be a fad or even dangerous.

Mr. Carmack and Meta did not respond to requests for comment. Insider earlier reported on Mr. Carmack’s departure.

Meta’s earnings have been hit hard by its spending on the metaverse and its slowing growth in social networking and digital advertising. In July, the Silicon Valley company posted its first sales decline as a public company. Last month, Meta said it was laying off about 11,000 employees, or about 13 percent of its work force, in what amounted to the company’s most significant job cuts.

In a podcast interview in August, Mr. Carmack said Meta’s $10 billion loss at the time in the division housing its augmented reality and virtual reality initiatives made him “sick to my stomach.” He added that the company’s metaverse efforts have been hampered by bureaucracy and dogged by concerns about diversity and privacy.

In other posts seen by The Times from this year, Mr. Carmack criticized features on the company’s Quest virtual reality headsets. In his farewell post, he commended the Quest 2 headset as “almost exactly what I wanted to see from the beginning” in terms of its cost and mobile hardware, though he was still critical of its software.

“We built something pretty close to The Right Thing,” he said.

Mr. Carmack’s post, which said he was ending his decade in V.R., concluded by saying he had “wearied of the fight” and would focus on his own start-up. (He announced in August that his artificial intelligence firm, Keen Technologies, had raised $20 million.)

“V.R. can bring value to most of the people in the world, and no company is better positioned to do it than Meta,” he wrote.

Before Meta, Mr. Carmack pioneered various techniques in computer graphics that became crucial to games that he developed, including Quake. He joined Oculus in 2013 as chief technology officer and stepped down from that role in 2019, moving into a part-time role.

Mr. Carmack this week also testified in a court hearing over the Federal Trade Commission’s attempt to block Meta’s purchase of Within, the virtual reality start-up behind a fitness game called Supernatural. The agency has argued that the tech giant will snuff out competition in the nascent metaverse if it is allowed to complete the deal. The hearing is expected to continue next week.",2022-12-17 23:37:00

Why do people want a Recession so bad?,1,zofgch,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zofgch/why_do_people_want_a_recession_so_bad/,232,1671309136.0,"I don't think most people understand what a Recession can do to you and your family. Let's go back to 2008. The amount of lay offs the amount of people out of college with degrees not being able to get a job at a KFC! The lines for interviews being insane. All you could do is think about how you were going to put food on the table for your family.

I really do think that a recession is going to fill in jobs that have been left vacant and will force people back into offices. (Although I am all for working from home). People might have a rude awakening. 

A lot of folks are wanting a recession to make money, and I understand that historically recessions have for the most part were great times to build wealth. But let me tell you when you have to pick between feeding your family and keeping the lights on then stocks will be the least of your worries.

Looking back I sold what I had and like many wish I could have kept my bags but I couldn't I had to cash out to support my family. Which I would do again.

I don't think this new generation will be able to handle a recession. The luxury of leaving one job and going to another won't be there and if you dont perform to a standard you will be replaced. (Which sucks)

I post this only because of the amount of folks I see waiting for a recession to hit so they can ""make money"" be careful what you wish for. 

Anywhoo most boomers have a paid off house and cash reserved to take advantage of this potential crash so they will benefit the most from this. (And blame others for the recession and ""free handouts"" (Their words not mine) 

We were bailed out in 2020 do you think you'll get a bailout with this kind of inflation? HA I think we will be forced to tough it out just like 2008 but I hope I am wrong.

CNN
 — 
From the executive suite to the grocery aisles to the halls of the Federal Reserve, the big question is: Can red-hot inflation be vanquished without tipping the economy into a recession?

Ironically, all this talking about a recession can actually help cause one. How people feel is a huge driver of consumer behavior and business planning. The famous British economist John Maynard Keynes coined the phrase “animal spirits” to describe what drives investors, consumers and business leaders. Fear, hope, uncertainty, and confidence are all hard to measure — and hugely important to how the economy fares.

Essentially, worrying about a recession and planning for one can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

“At the end of the day, a recession is a loss of faith,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Consumers worry about losing a job and so pull back on spending, and business leaders worry their sales will decline and start laying off workers.

“You get into this kind of self-reinforcing negative cycle,” he told CNN’s Early Start. “So when sentiment is this bad and starting to feed on itself, we run the risk of talking ourselves into one.”

The US economy grew at a 2.9% annual rate in the third quarter, and the unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. That’s not going to last. The Federal Reserve this week lowered its forecast for growth in the United States next year to just 0.5% and a jobless rate rising to 4.6% by the end of 2023.

“Look, we’re planning as if there’s going to be a mild recession next year,” United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told CNN This Morning. “And a lot of people in the business world are trying to talk ourselves into one is what it sometimes feels like to me.”

But he added, “If I didn’t watch business shows or read the Wall Street Journal, the word recession wouldn’t be in my vocabulary because we just don’t see it in our data.”

Bloomberg: Hedge Fund Manager Netting 29% Gain Sees S&P 500 Going Nowhere,15,zoeme8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zoeme8/bloomberg_hedge_fund_manager_netting_29_gain_sees/,9,1671306991.0,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-17/hedge-fund-manager-netting-29-gain-sees-s-p-500-going-nowhere

Excerpt from the article: 

With the specter of a recession on the horizon, Harnisch prefers companies whose revenues and profits will continue to increase regardless of how bad the economy goes. Businesses that offer that kind of resilience, he says, are those that tap into the ever rising demand for things like high-speed internet and clean energy — areas where the **government also plans to spend billions of dollars to promote growth.**

Hedge fund manager suggests investing in companies that receive robust government subsidies. Thoughts? Seems like people/firms with the greatest influence on stock prices remember the 2008 bailouts and expect something similar to happen again — also recall that Tesla and SpaceX built a ton of equity thanks in part to government subsidies in the hundreds of millions of dollars.",2022-12-17 21:56:31

Can someone explain why dividend investing is not worthwhile in the longrun?,146,zoczge,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zoczge/can_someone_explain_why_dividend_investing_is_not/,139,1671302654.0,"I read this [article on dividend investing](https://www.pwlcapital.com/some-tough-love-about-dividend-investing/) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pzltj7/hypothetical_80100_schd_set_it_and_forget_it/hf1r8cd/).

The argument against dividends seems to be two-fold: 1) you're taxed on the dividends, and 2) the share price drops in value by the amount of the dividend. 

My question is about #2. How much does this matter if the price of the stock rises? For example, if the stock is $100 today and they issue a $4 dividend, then supposedly the price will drop to $96. But what if the price of the stock increases over the year and it's $125 and they issue a $4 dividend, so the stock is $121. Aren't you as the dividend investor way ahead now?

I am primarily asking because I am trying to understand SCHD which has been going up over the past 6 moths. Although you get taxed on the SCHD dividends, it does not seem like #2 (share price dropping in value by the amount of the dividend) is occurring enough to make the stock unattractive, if anything it seems very attractive.

Also, since VTI pays dividends, doesn't it deal with the same #1 and #2 issues?

EDIT: this post is about holding SCHD in a taxable account

How are dividends accounted for in the stock chart performance?,17,zo5r54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zo5r54/how_are_dividends_accounted_for_in_the_stock/,25,1671281793.0,"Question: How are dividends accounted for in stock performance comparisons?

A company's stock price movement is often seen as a way of measuring the performance of a stock.

However, paying out dividends decreases stock price increase, since it decreases the assets of a company. If a stock has a 5% yield, then I would expect the stock to rise 5% less than a company with similar performance but no dividends.

&#x200B;

My understanding is that when I look at the performance summary of a stock ticker (how did it fare in the last 1m, 3m, 1y, 5y, etc), the dividends disappear. This would make dividend paying companies look weaker than they actually are.

Is my understanding correct, or are the dividends somehow acounted for in stock charts and statistics?",2022-12-17 14:56:33

US Bond ETFs for foreigners,1,znywuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/znywuh/us_bond_etfs_for_foreigners/,2,1671254419.0,"Hi, with the weakening of USD, I have accumulated some USD in the past few weeks and am looking for ETFs to store this money with 100% liquidity and good price stability/predictability. 

Background:

1. I am a non-US person
2. I pay 30% withholding tax on dividend
3. I pay 0% capital gain tax
4. My brokerage doesn't pay interest on idle money
5. My bank offers fixed deposit at around 3% p.a. interest with 1-month lock-in

I chanced upon some mentions of Bond ETFs like FLOT, SGOV, BIL/S, CLTL etc. I look at their monthly price movement and they seem very predictable, e.g. a drop on ex-div date, then gradually go up over the month. This may suit my needs well -- I will buy on ex-div and sell on eve of ex-div to avoid withholding tax, this gives me 100% liquidity, capital protection and a bit of interest from the idle money. 

Currently these Bond ETFs are paying around 2%, will they increase in coming months since the treasury yields are already close to 4%?

Before I do it, is there anything else that I may have overlooked? Thanks!",2022-12-17 07:20:19

Reflections of Poor Decisions in 2022,18,znww2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/znww2s/reflections_of_poor_decisions_in_2022/,46,1671247290.0,"As always, this in not financial advice. This is simply a public reflection of my thoughts on the year as it relates to my portfolio. Due your own due diligence and don’t trust the words of a random stranger on the internet.

This year I will likely end the year with a return -30% to -40%, currently down about 35%. As I have done (not on reddit) for several years now, I like to reflect on the quality of my decisions and the outcomes.

Entering 2022 I had the following holdings: GOOGL, AXP, BRKB, CHE, CHWY, CNSWF, DPZ, HIFS, LMND, MSFT, SPGI, SCI, TMX, TSLA, TOITF, U, YETI

During the year, I made the mistake of moving aggressively into beaten down low-quality tech. Names like U, LMND, PLTR, UPST, DDOG, OKTA, SHOP, TEAM, TOST. In terms of the quality of the decisions I would say that I was that I did not make complete well-rounded decisions. On one hand, I generally applaud myself for buying companies when they are out of favor. These names were down 40 to 60% at the time of purchase. Where I did not do well was look at more than factors other than torrid growth rate and a bright future fed to me on the beautiful pages embedded on their investor presentations (let’s look at that and avoid the skeletons in the 10-Q I said to myself). These companies were bought with too much sunshine and not enough rain.

I should have reviewed additional factors: 

First, how are the financials trending other than growth. Sure, revenue was going up gangbusters, what about margins, or dilution or capital requirements, Revenue/EE, Revenue/Sh etc. As I dug under the hood later in the year most of these companies made no advancement on margins despite torrid revenue growth. I realized not digging this far was very very stupid. 

Additionally, I realized throughout time the competitive landscape has changed and I need to update my assessment as well. Take DataDog. My belief about their competitive positioning was “due to the nature of their mission critical software companies are not likely to leave them due to the high switching costs.” One day I went over my portfolio holding by holding and I realized that I had virtually all software names that had an advantage in my view that stemmed from a switching cost. It kind of hit me this is ridiculous. How can every company have a switching cost advantage? The cloud changed everything. Without the need for servers, it is much easier to simply move from one company to another. Now of course there are still training costs and implementation costs to be sure, but the barriers to create software have never been lower and the number of options has never been higher. 

The realization that switching costs in my opinion is not stringent enough of a definition led me to investigate competitive advantages further. As I do often when I feel I have lost my way in investing, I revisit some legendary texts. This time, I revisited Terry Smith’s Owner’s Manual ([https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf](https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf)). In there, he has a section where he speaks about the types of companies they like. Here is what it said:

“We seek to invest in businesses whose assets are intangible and difficult to replicate

It may seem counter-intuitive to seek businesses which do not rely upon tangible assets, but bear with us. The businesses we seek to invest in do something very unusual: they break the rule of mean reversion that states returns must revert to the average as new capital is attracted to business activities earning super-normal returns.

They can do this because their most important assets are not physical assets, which can be replicated by anyone with access to capital, but intangible assets, which can be very difficult to replicate, no matter how much capital a competitor is willing to spend. Moreover, it’s hard for companies to replicate these intangible assets using borrowed funds, as banks tend to favor the (often illusory) comfort of tangible collateral. This means that the business does not suffer from economically irrational (or at least innumerate) competitors when credit is freely available.”

This section gave me an epiphany! To sum it up, businesses with competitive advantages are built in a way that capital alone is unable to reproduce. In other words, there has to be an intangible factor that capital is unable to recreate. I combined this idea with the other questions I typically ask myself.

· **Company Soundness**

o Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

o What is the competitive advantage?

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

· **Growth**

o Is their a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

· **Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

Answering these questions brought down a watchlist of \~75 names to 26.

This filter took names like Amazon off my list. In my opinion, Amazon derives most of its advantage from a long recurring investment in capital. Distribution centers for their retail business and data centers for AWS. Over time as firms have invested in DTC, this has marginalized much of Amazon’s advantage. Additionally, as more cloud players come into the space, the investment in data centers is becoming more common. Ironically, my opinion on Amazon is add odds with Terry Smith given his position in Amazon. As they say, that is what makes a market. Just pull up annual return on assets and you will see one of the reasons why Amazon is plummeting.

Below is my refined list of 26 companies and why I feel capital alone will be able to replicate them sorted alphabetically by name.

Company Ticker Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB Network Effect for Airbnb's. Customers want to shop for Airbnb's where the hosts are. Host want to list where the customers are. 

American Express Company AXP Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

Apple Inc. AAPL Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want phones where they can access the services they customarily use. The Duopoly has been attacked by Microsoft and Amazon, yet we still only have two phone systems.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B Reputation. BRK's reputation has a financial powerhouse makes its insurance division one of the few insurers that can be trusted with large and complex risks. Additionally, management unique operating structure allows for very little conglomerate penalty due to the individual management of many businesses.

BlackRock, Inc. BLK Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history with Blackrock and iShares it will be difficult to upset these funds

Blackstone Inc. BX Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history across many alternatives it is difficult to select a smaller player.

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F  Decentralized operating culture. Management acquires small niche vertically integrated software providers. Their capital allocation is uniquely pushed down to distant levels fromtop management which allows them to scale acquisitions on a decentralized basis. This extremely unique management approach is not something money can buy.

Costco Wholesale Corporation COST Low-Cost Provider. By selling items virtually at cost along with leveraging negotiating powers to drive lowest prices Costco has cemented a foothold in retail. All this value is captured in their annual membership fee.

CRA International, Inc. CRAI Reputation. Within Business consulting, CRAI has a reputation for solving large complex solutions across many industries. When a consultant work with 78 of the fortune 100, you know that paying high fees for results is worth it.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD Network Effect. CRWD's cloud-based cybersecurity solutions and massive customer base allows for quick handling of threats. As one threat is dealt with, the solutions are synced through the rest of their cloud-based service. This means helping one client helps all and the more customers the strong the service.

Fair Isaac Corporation FICO Regulatory Entrenchment and track record. The FICO score is synonymous with personal lending. Often it is a key determinant for determining loan eligibility. Given its efficient track record at quantifying risk, newer options will be behind as they don't have the track record.

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS Culture of Discipline. There are many banks in this world, virtually none of them are as efficient as HIFS. Their disciplined culture toward underwriting leads to lower than industry average charge offs annually while their focus on costs leads to above industry profitability. If you could re-create this with capital, banks with more scale would have similar returns.

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. IDXX Trade Secrets. IDXX offers many proprietary tests for vets. This means that only IDXX labs can process them. Additionally, many vets are trained on their tests meaning switching would result in the need for new training.

Lemonade, Inc. LMND Potential to be low-Cost provider and culture of customer care. By offering insurance DTC, Lemonade can avoid many entrenched costs from agency model. Additionally, by getting Guinness World Records for fastest claim paid and removing the frustrating part of insurance which is using it, they have the potential to earn pricing power over time

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU Network Effect. In Latin America they are the leading provider of a P2P payment system (like Venmo). They have captured sizeable portions of the populations in Brazil, Mexico and Columbia.

RLI Corp. RLI Disciplined Underwriting culture and unique track record. Their underwriting culture had led to a 10 BPs lower combined ratio and lower ratio every year for the last decade. Money can't buy discipline. They insure a broad spectrum of odd risks. These are both not easily replicated but offer great diversification in their operations.

Rollins, Inc. ROL Low-Cost Provider. As the largest player in most of their markets, Rollin's benefits from major scale advantages. More contracts allow for pest control people to have greater route density during a day and therefore greater profits as well as negotiate better terms on inputs. This is something that a competitor is unable to solve by throwing money at it. Additionally with high brand awareness with Orkin man, they have a step up on smaller lesser-known players.

Roper Technologies, Inc. ROP Decentralized operating culture focused on end markets that benefit from efficient scale. Efficient scale is when an end market is logically only served by one player in a small area, like a freelance truck distributor. If you are looking for a delivery truck, it makes sense that one website would be best for that.

S&P Global Inc. SPGI Regulatory Entrenchment and Track Record. S&Ps credit rating are required by many contracts and regulations for many debt deals. If you need money and your bank requires it, you’re going to pay a hefty fee for their rating. Additionally, they own the IP for the S&P and Dow Jones indexes. These long track records will never be replaced due to their entrenchment and first mover advantage.

Salesforce, Inc. CRM Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Salesforce is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

ServiceNow, Inc. NOW Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. ServiceNow is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

Shopify Inc. SHOP Network effect. For eCommerce players that are looking to compete independently from the likes of Amazon, Shopify is their lifeblood. This means that App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Smaller player and late entries like BigCommerce have struggled to gain traction

Tesla, Inc. TSLA Network effect, Brand, Unique Operating Culture in a tough industry. Network effects stem from outsized number of cars on road all outfitted with self-driving equipment giving Tesla more data to develop self-driving cars giving them a data advantage for developing self-driving cars. Additionally, Tesla is the undisputed electric vehicle king given their first mover advantage. Finally, they operate differently than most of their competitors. They build the important and unique components in house whereas legacy auto tends to outsource all parts and simply assemble them. They sell DTC at retail prices whereas legacy auto sell wholesale to dealers. They have a standard labor force whereas most of legacy auto has unionized labor which is trained on legacy ICE engines. The auto industry is historically difficult to enter as it requires large amounts of capital, high fixed costs with a cyclical product.

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN You can't re-create the limited supply of mountains in the world. There are so many mountains and locations with the proper weather conditions to enable skiing. This gives them pricing power, particularly when you account for how many mountains they own in many regions.

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN Government granted monopoly. All .com and .net domains must be registered with VRSN. Additionally, price increases are regulated. Fortunately, ROCs are not

Visa Inc. V Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

From there I reviewed the 26 companies by valuation and felt 15 of them are compelling investments at this time:

Company Ticker Target

Visa Inc. V 10.00%

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B 10.00%

Blackstone Inc. BX 8.00%

American Express Company AXP 8.00%

Salesforce, Inc. CRM 8.00%

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F  8.00%

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS 6.00%

Tesla, Inc. TSLA 6.00%

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN 6.00%

Lemonade, Inc. LMND 5.00%

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU 5.00%

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB 5.00%

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN 5.00%

Shopify Inc. SHOP 5.00%

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD 5.00%

I feel much more confident in the portfolio after re-reviewing the soundness, ability to be replicated, future growth prospects. They key for future years is to avoid laziness when analyzing names. It is foolhardy and expensive to fall in love with an investor presentation and then go and buy it on hopes and dreams rather than seeing the larger picture.

The ironic thing is I have owned 14 of the 15 at some point in my life. For one reason or another I got shaken out of them and bought into the temptress that goes by the name of high growth. Like most temptresses, more research reveals not much substance.

For next steps, I will work on integrating the above process into my stock review routine and stick to it. I find that the hardest part with investing is simply sticking to a practical approach. Its too easy to waver to something new. Variety is the spice of life, but makes for the taste of cocoa powder in investments.

Obviously, these are just my opinions. I welcome your feedback.",2022-12-17 05:21:30

Largely just a video game at this point, though I've taken out like 200% profit overall mostly from stupid stuff like Tesla lol. Lately I've been experimenting with buying calls and puts on a few stocks I follow, and trying to understand how those work.

Two of those calls was for MAXR at $35 on 4/21/2023. I bought 2 contracts at $1.10 about 2 months ago, and today they're each worth $17.60.

Maxar got bought by Advent International, and shareholders receive $53.00 a share. So MAXR is currently at $51.70. I *kind of* understand that each contract I own is good for buying 100 shares of MAXR at $35 until 4/21/2023, so now that the actual price is well above that number, my contracts are now ""in the money""... Is that right? So now what? lol.

I also own some dozen shares in MAXR. What happens to my shares after this buyout? What happens to my call contracts after this buyout? Should I sell them or hang on to them? Does MAXR stop existing? Since I have two, I was thinking about at least selling one on Monday. 1700 bucks pays for the paint job my bumper needs.

Is selling long covered call a good tactic for delaying taxes?,16,znszsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/znszsv/is_selling_long_covered_call_a_good_tactic_for/,40,1671235183.0,"Let’s say I buy at $10 and it ran to $20. I don’t want to pay for short term gains taxes. But can I sell a covered call at like $5 expiring more than one year from now and let’s say I sell each contract for like $16.5. I walk away with the cash. After 1 year, the stock is called away and I get the remaining cash.

Then I net gained like $11.5 per stock and it’s a long term gain instead of a short term gain and is then taxed slightly less. Plus I only need to worry about paying the tax the next year (so about 2 years from now!) when taxes are filed.

Of course I can lose more if the stock run more. But if I don’t expect the stock to run, or I’m perfectly ok with giving up more gains, this seems to be a reasonable tactic to ‘sell but don’t pay taxes now’?

Edit: solved. It depends on how long you have been holding the stock before writing the CC. The holding period gets suspended when you write CC against it. When your shares gets called away, you are taxed on (premium + strike) - cost basis. 

So if you hold the stock for 1month and then write CC. Then no matter how long the CC is, your taxes are short term. If you hold the stock for 1year+ then write CC, that gain will be long term.

So this strategy is only good for DELAYing taxes, not good for making short term gain long term.",2022-12-17 01:59:43

*****
> Stocks dropped Friday, building on their year-end sell-off, as fears grow over a recession taking place as the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 281.76 points, or 0.85%, to 32,920.46. The S&P 500 fell 1.11% to 3,852.36. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.97% to 10,705.41.
*****
> The indexes notched a second consecutive week of losses. The S&P 500 fell 2.08% for the week, and putting its December losses at 5.58%, as hopes for a year-end rally fizzle. The Dow and Nasdaq slid 1.7% and 2.7%, respectively.
*****
> Trading was especially volatile Friday with a large amount of options expiring. There were $2.6 trillion worth of index options expiring, the highest amount “relative to the size of the equity market in nearly two years,” according to Goldman Sachs. At session lows, the Dow was down as much as 547.63 points, before paring back some of those losses.
*****
> The sell-off was broad-based, with three stocks falling for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange. At one point, there were only 10 S&P 500 names in positive territory. The real estate and consumer discretionary sectors were the biggest laggards, down nearly 3% and 1.7%, respectively.
*****

> # Santa Claus Rally, Mid-December Low & January Indicator Trifecta

> Wall Street, MSM and social are abuzz with Santa Claus Rally chatter and hype this week, but everyone has it all wrong. I can see Yale’s big grin shining down on us as his famous indicator and catchphrase reverberate on The Street.

> They argue their case for why the “Santa Claus Rally” will or won’t come to town this year. But they miss the point. Yale Hirsch invented and named the Santa Claus Rally in 1972, published in the 1973 Almanac. Oh lord, it is still misunderstood. It’s not a trading strategy, it’s an indicator!

> SCR is the short, sweet rally that runs from the last 5 trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. S&P 500 posts an average gain of 1.3%. Failure to rally tends to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be purchased at lower prices later in the year.

> To wit Yale’s famous line: “If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come To Broad And Wall.” (Stock Trader’s Almanac 2023 p 118).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c6285b39d656e4d47a2825774f0ebca7/14d8e7b82ba5eca8-a9/s500x750/c2684ec719407200da72d1e590a56cbc11015917.jpg))**

> The current situation is reminiscent of 1974. Midterm October low, December retest. Lots of dire news and conditions. The Fed is clearly done taking orders from Wall Street and Washington and is bent on halting inflation. Their quarterly dot plot ticked up and it looks like at least one more 50bps hike. It’s working, inflation is decelerating. Reality is we will have higher inflation and rates for a while.

> But we have already been in a bear and likely a recession. Bear markets bottom before recessions end and bull markets start when The Street least expects and practically everyone is a bear right now. While it sure looks ugly out there, we contend the worst is behind and a nascent bull is trying to emerge.

> Stocks tend to bottom here in mid-December ahead of the seasonally strong last half of the month, especially small caps – what used to be the “January Effect.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/abe551038af905961dbe224f3309291b/14d8e7b82ba5eca8-dd/s500x750/bf884d42dce190a9e6386a7bab4025a8131b2f8d.jpg))**

> The results of the Santa Claus Rally along with the other two components of our “January Indicator Trifecta,” the first five days of January and the full month January Barometer (also created by Yale Hirsch in 1972) will help solidify our outlook for next year.

> When all three are up the S&P 500 has been up 90% of the time, 28 of 31 years, with an average gain of 17.5%. When any of them are down the year’s results are reduced and when all three are down the S&P was down 3 of 8 years with an average loss of -3.6% with bear markets in 1969 (-11.4%), 2000 (-10.1%) and 2008 (-38.5%), flat years in 1956 (2.6%), 1978 (1.1%) and 2005 (3.0%). Down Trifecta’s were followed by gains in 1982 (14.8%) and 2016 (9.5%).

> Keep your eye on the SCR for signs of a new bull or continuing bear. Then watch for the rest of our “January Indicator Trifecta” FFD and JB. When all 3 agree the market generally follows suit.

> We are anticipating a SCR this year. Inflation is easing, the Fed is likely to be done with rate increases in Q1 and we also see supply chain constraints fading now that China is loosening its Covid-19 restrictions. Seasonally speaking, we are also in the middle of the historically strongest period for stocks, the “Sweet Spot of the 4-Year Cycle,” Q4 of midterm years through Q2 of pre-election year.

> # 5 Things To Know About Recessions And Bear Markets

> “I am an optimist because I don’t see the point in being anything else.” Abraham Lincoln

> With all the talk about a pending recession and stocks in a bear market, today, I wanted to share some more thoughts and stats on recessions and bear markets.

> First things first, we do not currently anticipate a recession in 2023, which is quite opposite of the general consensus. You can read more about that here and here.

> What exactly is a bear market? For the definition of a bear market, we are using the traditional definition, which is an index down 20% or more from the recent peak. Yes, there isn’t much difference between 19.8% and 20.0%, so we will also include some near bear markets as well, but when we say bear market, that is what we mean.

> First, do all bear markets take place in a recession? Turns out they don’t, as stocks, indeed can have a bear market without a recession. The worst ever was the 34% bear during the Crash of 1987, which all took place without a recession.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-197-800x595.png))**

> Second, taking things a step further, here we broke down the performance based on if the bear market took place in a recession or not. Take note; we did include some ‘near bear markets’ this time to get more instances. Plus, a near bear feels like a bear market if you are in it. What still amazes us about the table below is that the average bear market without a recession was 24%, and this recent bear was 25%. Assuming we avoid a recession and October was indeed low, this was right on the bullseye.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-264-800x361.png))**

> Now take another look at the table above. The last few bear markets recovered quite quickly. In fact, the last three bear markets that didn’t have a recession recovered in four, four, and three months. Something to think about here, as stocks are two months off the October lows.

> Third, this has been making the rounds lately and has been adding to some of the worries. Looking at all the bear markets that took place around a recession, not once did the bear market end before the recession started. In other words, if we are indeed headed for a recession in 2023, this could suggest that new lows may also be quite likely. Incredibly, bears don’t end for another nine months on average after the recession started, before they find their ultimate low. Again, we don’t see a recession, so this wouldn’t be the case now, but the data is quite compelling.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BearMarketEnds-800x332.png))**

> Fourth, the month of October tends to be a bear-market killer. Most bears have met their end during the month of October, more than any other month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/OctoberEnds-800x338.png))**

> Below, we break down those previous 17 bear (or near bear) markets. The bottom line six of them ended in October, and we think there’s a very good chance number seven just happened.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-632-800x455.png))**

> Fifth and lastly, if October was indeed the bear market low, be open to the idea of higher prices over the coming two years. While not a predictor of future behavior, history shows the markets were up more than 40% a year off of the bear-market lows and up almost 60% two years off of them. During uncertain and volatile situations (like the ones that markets have treated us to in 2022), it can be hard to imagine a positive path forward, and all we see are the obstacles. Stepping back a bit can be a helpful reminder of the resiliency of the markets over the long term.

> Dr. Seuss said, “Sometimes the questions are complicated, and the answers are simple.” To me, bear markets can be confusing and complicated, but the answer has always been that they indeed do eventually end, and historically better times will come when they do.

> # 2022 US Stock Market Snapshot

> With just a couple more weeks left in the year, the S&P is down 18.2% year-to-date, which is tracking for the worst year since the Financial Crisis in 2008. As shown below, we've seen huge monthly volatility throughout the year within an overall downtrend. If December's declines hold, we'll have seen a move of 3% or more in either direction in eleven of twelve months this year. September has (so far) been the worst month with a decline of 9.3%, while July was the best month with a gain of 9.1%. In terms of weekday performance, Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays have averaged declines this year, while Tuesdays and Wednesdays have averaged small gains.

> # Energy Losing Its Grip

> You know those scenes in the movies where a character finds themselves hanging off a bridge, and slowly their sweaty grip starts to loosen as a finger or two starts to slip? That's what the energy sector is going through right now. As oil prices have been under pressure over the last few months, energy stocks had been holding up relatively well as the S&P 500 Energy sector hit a new cycle high exactly a month ago today. Since then, the sector has declined nearly 9% even as the S&P 500 has moved higher. Last week, the sector broke below its 50-DMA for the first time in over two months before stabilizing this week. Since that break below the 50-DMA on 12/6, the sector has made multiple intraday attempts (including today) to get back above it, but each time the sector has sold off and finished off its intraday highs. When looking at a price chart, any time you see a security break below a key moving average and then make several unsuccessful attempts to get back above that level, it's often a sign of a momentum shift.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/121422-XLE.png))**

> On a relative strength basis, the Energy sector is also toeing a key trendline. The chart below compares the relative strength of XLE to the S&P 500 (SPY) over the last year. During that time, Energy's relative strength has been riding a trendline higher with bounces each time it kissed that level. The most recent example occurred this week, but at this point, the bounce has been meager. Energy stocks have been outperforming energy commodities in recent months, so it's only natural to see some mean reversion in the stocks as well, but with the sector already breaking below its 50-DMA, this is a key trendline to watch. If the sector's relative strength weakens further, the technical picture for the sector would weaken materially, which would be a development investors in just about every other sector wouldn't shed a tear for.

> # The Monetary Policy Conversation is Going to Shift in 2023

> First, the good news –

> * The Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points (bps) to the 4.25-4.50% range – a step down from the 75 bps rate hike pace they went with at the last four meetings. This was expected, but it’s always good to see confirmation.
> * They also said that “ongoing rate increases will be necessary” and raised their estimate of the peak rate from 4.6% to 5.1% in 2023, which was not a big surprise. What’s important is that the end of the rate hike cycle is near. The estimate revisions are nowhere as large as what we had seen earlier this year. At the end of 2021, they estimated rates to peak at 2.1% and then continuously shifted those up by 0.6% – 1% increments every three months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-14-median-fed-funds-rate-expectation-600x800.png))**

> The not-so-good news: They also provided revised estimates for the economy, which wasn’t great.

> * They revised economic growth lower, from 1.2% to 0.5% (2023)
> * They revised the unemployment rate higher, from 4.4% to 4.6% (about 1% point higher than where it is now)
> * They revised core inflation higher, from 3.1% to 3.5% (2023)

> While Fed Chair Powell was careful to say that they don’t believe these forecasts qualify as a recession, keep in mind that the U.S. has never experienced a 1% rise in the unemployment rate outside of a recession.

> But if you notice, I said “not so good news” instead of “bad news.” Powell pointed out that these are members’ best estimates “as of today,” but that could change as new data comes in. And we have plenty of data coming in. Before their March meeting (when they update the projections again), we have three more inflation reports, three employment reports, and an employment cost index report (which is a preferred gauge of wage growth).

> If you look back at the previous chart, we’ve seen significant shifts in rate expectations just over the course of this year. There’s no reason to think we won’t see more revisions if the data cooperates.

> # The shift: From how fast and how high to how long
> The conversation in 2022 revolved around inflation, which surged to the highest level since 1981. As a result, we saw the most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in four decades as the Federal Reserve (Fed) looked to get on top of inflation. The Fed’s singular focus was to ensure they did more than “enough” to lower inflation. Consequently, the over-arching question on investors’ minds across the year was how quickly the Fed would raise rates, and how high they would go.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-14-fed-funds-target-rate-601x800.png))**

> I believe that’s going to shift in 2023. Fed officials will likely start thinking about balance again: the risk of tightening too much vs. the risk of not doing enough. Powell mentioned this in comments he made a couple of weeks ago but didn’t mention it again in his post-FOMC meeting press conference. The omission was curious, more so because we just got a second consecutive inflation report that surprised us to the downside. All he said was that, while the report was encouraging, they need substantially more evidence to believe that inflation has turned a corner. And so, they’ll keep rates “sufficiently restrictive.”

> I think it was probably more a matter of Fed officials not having enough time to digest the report and not revising estimates accordingly. But as I wrote, the prospects of softer inflation in 2023 look good. There is enough reason to believe that disinflation will kick in as we get into the backend of 2023, especially if energy prices don’t spike again and core goods prices continue to ease. Official rental inflation starts to reflect market rents (which are falling rapidly). All of which makes it likely that estimate revisions will happen.

> So, the question for investors will also shift—from how fast and how high to how long and how long they will keep interest rates at an overly restrictive level. The conversation will revolve around how many months of soft inflation data they need to see and how soft it must be. This could obviously take some time since inflation is not going to go down in a straight line – there may be fits and starts and false alarms, but the trend is clear.

> # The risk of “transitory” deflation
> What will upset the apple cart is that the disinflation we see in goods prices and housing is deemed transitory by the Fed, and they maintain rates at an overly tight level. This is not an insignificant risk. Powell again mentioned core services inflation, excluding housing in his press conference. He tied it to wage growth and a tight labor market. This group includes personal care services, education, childcare costs, wireless services, insurance fees, etc. – all captured in the light blue bar in the chart below.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-15-core-CPI-576x800.png))**

> As you can see, the good news is that the light blue bar just made its lowest contribution to core inflation in four months. The risk is that the Fed looks past all of this. Instead, they use wage growth and other labor market metrics as their guiding light as they think about “how long to stay restrictive.”

> I think the odds are weighted in favor of them moving lower once inflation starts to fall rapidly, though only by the end of 2023 at the earliest. Which is not as early and not as big cuts as the market currently expects.

*****

> # Is Anyone Bullish?

> “The future ain’t what it used to be.” Yogi Berra

> We’ve noticed a recent trend: nearly no one is looking for stocks to do much in 2023. As Yogi said many years ago, the future ain’t looking too good.

> The general consensus is that the first half of next year could be very rough, with many banks and investment shops expecting stocks to go back to new lows. Here’s a tweet I did summarizing some of the recent calls.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-195-800x364.png))**

> Adding to this, for one of the first times ever, Bloomberg data showed that Wall Street Strategists expect negative returns for the S&P 500 next year. That just doesn’t happen, or it didn’t happen until now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-275.jpg))**

> We’ve also noticed a considerable spike in put volume over the past week, another way of showing how potentially worried the masses are currently. Then yesterday, I saw this headline, adding to the festive mood.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-361-800x228.png))**

> Here are two more signs of near-historic levels of skepticism. First, the recent Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey showed a record low level of risk appetite. In other words, lower than the financial crisis and COVID.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-410.png))**

> Second, our friends at TDAmeritrade have proprietary data showing retail investors near the lowest level of sentiment since April 2020. This is called the Investor Movement Index (IMX), which measures what investors are actually doing and how they are positioning in markets. Again, not a lot of excitement out there.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-581-800x523.png))**

> There’s an old Wall Street adage that it is hard to get hurt falling out of a basement window, and we think that could be the case now. Our take is that an incredible amount of negativity is priced into markets currently, and any good news could continue the recent strength off the October lows. Or, as General Patton said, “If everyone is thinking alike, somebody isn’t thinking.”

> What could spark it? It’ll likely be better trends in inflation, which could open the door for the Fed to turn slightly more dovish. Coupled with what we continue to believe is a healthy and robust consumer, the economy may likely avoid the recession that many are expecting. We discussed better trends in inflation here and here.

> It is hard for us not to keep pointing out that it is extremely rare for stocks to fall two years in a row. The S&P 500 was down two years in a row in ’73 and ’74 (one of the worst recessions ever), then three years after the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s, that’s it. Even during the financial crisis, stocks only fell in 2008 before a significant rebound in 2009.

> As the table below shows, it pays not to drive the car looking at the rearview mirror, as what just happened likely won’t happen again. As every time stocks fell in a midterm year (likely where we land in 2022), they bounced back the following year each time and gained 25% on average. Now, to be clear, we aren’t saying stocks will gain 25% next year… But we are saying it isn’t as crazy as it sounds.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/table-for-joey-800x375.png))**

> Warren Buffett said, “Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.” Things haven’t been good for investors this year, but there are many opportunities to plant some trees today and benefit from what we predict to be a surprisingly good year for investors in 2023.

> # VIX Death Cross Historically Bullish for S&P 500 over Next 2 Weeks

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/701d12ab931a8e09d896aca1743b79b8/45d979a75554c1bd-aa/s500x750/84cf1e777c0891ca4ee5224dedf9b08cf23f5650.jpg))**

> On Friday December 9, a Death Cross appeared on a chart of CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). A Death Cross occurs when the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. When this happens to an individual stock or major index like S&P 500 it is normally considered bearish. But since the VIX is designed to measure near-term market volatility the lower it goes the better the S&P 500 usually performs. Thus, a VIX Death Cross can be a bullish indication.

> Going back to 1990, including the most recent cross, there have been 36 VIX Death Crosses. The S&P 500’s average performance 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the past 35 VIX Death Crosses have been plotted in the following chart. In the 30 trading days prior to the VIX Death Cross, S&P 500 rose an average of 4.1%. This solid advance is what played a large role in the VIX Death Cross as a rising market is normally accompanied by falling volatility and a declining VIX. After the Death Cross, S&P 500 continued to climb another 2.5% over the next 60 trading days.

> Also included on the chart are the 35 VIX Golden Crosses. A Golden Cross is just the opposite of a Death Cross, the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average as VIX is rising. A VIX Golden Cross is not a good event for S&P 500 as it has typically declined an average 2.4% before the VIX Golden Cross and failed to return to breakeven 60 trading days later.

> In following tables, we present the S&P 500 performance after past VIX Death Crosses and VIX Golden Crosses across various timeframes. Based upon average performance the near-term, 1-and 2-week S&P 500 performance following a VIX Death Cross is better than a VIX Golden Cross, but by 1-month later and beyond the results are less clear. This would suggest that the current VIX Death Cross is likely bullish in the near-term, but not a great indication much beyond 2-weeks.

The S&P 500 does pretty terribly during recessions (nothing new there) and returns are middling/mixed in the runup to a recession (-8.1%/+3.6% on average, respectively). What surprised me was gold. Generally positive but middling performance during a recession (+4% on average). But gold absolutely trounced the market in the year before a recession--up 35.6% on average.

Ending the week with Quadruple Witching,12,znm4dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/znm4dh/ending_the_week_with_quadruple_witching/,6,1671216996.0,"End of Week Re-cap

* Markets Down Following Fed Announcement
* Yield Curve Inversion Taking a Toll
* Disappointing Retail Report
* Quadruple Witching

Major market indices are down on the week, most of those losses coming in the wake of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve announcement. Heading into Friday, the S&P 500 is off 2.5%, Nasdaq Composite is off 3.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost just over 2%. With today being a quadruple witching day, there is certainly a possibility for it to be another volatile day.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced a half point increase in short term lending rates. While markets were largely expecting that, the news that followed sent stocks lower. Although the Fed anticipates less aggressive rate hikes moving forward, their target level of 5 – 5.5% is slightly higher than many expected. The Fed also expects to reach that level in 2023 and hold rates their until 2024. That news dashed hopes that the Fed would begin easing sometime in 2023.

Although the Fed is raising shorter term rates, the yield curve remains severely inverted. Yields on 2-year notes are currently around 4.2% while the yield on the 5- year note is 3.61%. Those rates fall even further as you go out in time with 10-year notes yielding just over 3.1%. It probably shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise then that financial stocks in the S&P 500 are down 6.5% this month. Financial institutions often lend money out for long durations of time but are forced to borrow over shorter periods. Therefore, lending money at 3% but paying over 4% to borrow is taking its toll.

Yesterday, we received the most recent data on retail sales. November retail sales were down 0.6% compared with October (not adjusted for inflation). That marked the biggest month-over-month drop this year and comes during the all-important holiday shopping season. Auto sales were down sharply which could be a precursor for the housing market.

Finally, today is a quadruple witching. Options on stocks, stock indices, futures and futures options all expire today. The notional amount of options expiring today alone is a massive $4 trillion. December expiration is also commonly considered the last day of liquidity for the year as volumes tend to subside heading into the last couple weeks of the year. 

The VIX is around 23.5 in premarket, well above its historical average. We have already seen the impact of volatility on markets this year. The Nasdaq has recorded 83 days of moves +/-2% which is the most it has seen since 2002 when it notched 84 days. Another volatile day isn’t out of the question, especially with the catalyst of quadruple witching.

Real Impact of China Reopening,21,znlo9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/znlo9k/real_impact_of_china_reopening/,15,1671215793.0,"Generally I have seen a positive reactions to the China reopening news in financial publications and finance subreddits but little discussion on how the reopening is almost certainly a significant factor the Fed is thinking about. 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-15/bridgewater-s-jensen-says-china-reopening-adds-risk-to-us-and-europe-growth](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-15/bridgewater-s-jensen-says-china-reopening-adds-risk-to-us-and-europe-growth)[?](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-15/bridgewater-s-jensen-says-china-reopening-adds-risk-to-us-and-europe-growth?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=twitter)

*"" The Bridgewater co-chief investment officer said the shutdowns in China have been a “blessing” for the rest of the world by slowing the second-largest economy.*

*“It’s been such a disinflationary force into a global inflation,” he said on Bloomberg TV Thursday. “China opening and the effect that’s going to have on commodity prices, in competing for raw materials in the world, while the US and Europe are entering recession, will probably make the central banking dilemma worse.”*

And he isn't wrong. For the first 10 months of 2022 China crude demand was down an average-1.8 million barrel/day. While China crude demand was down, its refineries were still operating, thus creating artificial new supply in processed fuels like diesel and kerosene. This is reflected in other commodities like palm oil where China is the second largest importer (imports fell by 44% year-on-year), and LNG. The LNG situation is pretty interesting, China is the largest LNG importer, and demand is set to fall 1% this year. They are not participating in the LNG spot market this winter which is good news for Europe which basically gets all their lng right now from the spot market. 

Either way, its a pretty safe assumption that any supply chain smoothing out that ending zero covid brings will be canceled out by China's dramatic return to the global commodity markets. The recent  December Politburo meeting should have you a little more worried too. For the first time ever "" 扩大内需 "" ( means expanding domestic demand) was emphasized more then the traditional supply side investment rhetoric. The readout also mentions "" *We should focus on expanding domestic demand and give full play to the foundational role of consumption and the key role of investment.* "" In my view this means that western style stimulus checks are an idea China's legislators are considering (source here in Chinese  [http://www.news.cn/politics/leaders/2022-12/07/c\_1129188720.htm](http://www.news.cn/politics/leaders/2022-12/07/c_1129188720.htm)) 

Either way a recovering Chinese economy, particularly if the recovery comes very fast, will put a lot of pressure on central banks. Important to remember that 54% of China's GDP comes from domestic consumption compared to 27% from manufacturing.  It will definitely increase the period of rate hikes needed to get to the Fed's desired inflation number.",2022-12-16 20:36:33

How we could be wrong (Morgan Stanley GIC),35,znkdaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/znkdaw/how_we_could_be_wrong_morgan_stanley_gic/,24,1671212427.0,"The latest GIC report from Morgan Stanley, published Dec 12, 2022: [https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/mscampaign/wealth-management/wmir-assets/gic-weekly.pdf](https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/mscampaign/wealth-management/wmir-assets/gic-weekly.pdf)

The first paragraph lays out MS' current thinking and positioning:

""Recent US equity resilience has been based largely on a belief that the Federal Reserve will execute a soft landing in 2023, forestalling the current bear market. That view has been expressed in a consensus 2023 S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) projection of $230, which contrasts with our $195 forecast that assumes nonrecessionary profit declines amid lower corporate pricing power and sales volumes. One way we could be wrong is if cost cutting proves historically effective, but that would likely take a toll on consumption and employment, accelerating an economic slowdown. While such a scenario would prompt the Fed to cut rates, it would likely increase recession odds. Alternatively, labor market strength and consumer spending could surprise to the upside, helping to sustain profits. In such a scenario, however, risks around “higher for longer” fed funds rise, resulting in a threat to equity prices from lower valuation multiples, rather than weaker earnings. There are always three ways to be wrong about the market: by misjudging multiples, earnings or both. With uncertainty around those variables historically high, we prefer to harvest risk premium for the privilege of waiting. Consider tax-loss harvesting— especially passive index positions—and investing proceeds in yieldproducing assets like Treasuries, municipals, corporates, MLPs, residential REITs, and value-oriented and high-dividend equities.""

&#x200B;

The chart of the week is fascinating and reflects the tremendous uncertainty:  ""The divergence in S&P 500 price targets from market strategists has only been this wide once in the last 15 years."" The chart shows a spread of \~32% which is just below the peak from 2009 \~33%.

&#x200B;

Obviously the focus is on the Fed: ""We have noted that the peak fed funds rate has historically occurred when the Federal Reserve has managed to raise the policy rate above its preferred measure of inflation—the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE). With core PCE still running at just over 5%, even next week’s anticipated 50-basis-point hike suggests the Fed has more work to do. The fed funds futures curve agrees and is pricing two more 25-basis point hikes between January and May 2023.""",2022-12-16 19:40:27

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

It is a contested topic for sure, but aside, does cannabis have revenue potential in a legal retail setting? Can big publicly traded companies profit off of what is essentially a plant; What advantage do these companies have over small business growers and small business dispensaries? In Colorado, so much weed flooded the market from growers that it drove the price down a lot. 

You can make the argument that they could possibly have control over the medical cannabis sector. But from personal experience, most people use their medical marijuana licenses a purely in recreational way. For people that do actually have chronic pain, I’d imagine they would just start shopping retail because of lower prices.

Cannabis legalization is ultimately stuck to individual states, and moving with the slow turning wheels of democracy.

"10 Tesla Investors Lose $132.5 Billion From Musk's Twitter Fiasco. Interestingly, Musk sold $3.5 billion in tsla stock from 12-14.",319,zmp0uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zmp0uv/10_tesla_investors_lose_1325_billion_from_musks/,135,1671120995.0," 

**Tesla** ([**TSLA**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) investors are growing tired of Elon Musk's Twitter fiasco. And for good reason.

The 10 largest investors in the electric-vehicle maker's stock, including ETF giants Vanguard, **BlackRock** ([**BLK**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) and [**Musk himself**](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/elon-musk-sp500-lost-this-staggering-amount-on-tesla-stock/), lost nearly $133 billion since Twitter's board accepted Musk's buyout on April 25, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and [**MarketSmith**](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).

It cost Musk the position as the richest person in the world. But he's not alone feeling the pain.

## Tesla Stock Dropping Like A Rock

Tesla's value is down more than 52% since the Twitter buyout was approved on April 25, while the S&P 500 is only off 5.5%. And Tesla stock is off 29% since the deal closed on Oct. 27, much worse than the S&P 500's 6.6% gain in that time. Shares are down again Wednesday, by 3.4% to 155.38.

That's shredding a jaw-dropping amount of wealth for Tesla investors. The value of Tesla is down $339 billion from the Twitter deal's approval and $206 billion from the close.

Investors worry that Musk is so infatuated with Twitter, he's not minding Tesla.

Investors owning shares of Tesla, now down more than 50% this year, are vocally expressing displeasure. ""There is no TSLA CEO today,"" Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, which is down nearly $18 million on its Tesla stock since April, tweeted Monday, as [**first reported by the Wall Street Journal**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-investors-voice-concern-over-elon-musks-focus-on-twitter-11670948786?mod=hp_lead_pos7).

## It's Not Just Costing Elon Musk

Musk is definitely [**suffering the most from the Tesla implosion**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-burned-as-musk-goes-ballistic-on-twitter/). As the largest shareholder with 14.1% of the company, he's personally lost $47.9 billion from the time the Twitter deal closed.

But losses are spreading to Main Street, too, as the giant ETF and mutual fund companies are the next biggest owners. Vanguard, which is [**forecasting a recession**](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-vanguard-predicts-global-recession-next-year-why-to-believe/) next year, is the No. 2 largest holder of Tesla stock. It owns nearly 7% of the company. And due to that, its shareholders are down nearly $23 billion from the Twitter deal close.

What will Musk's infatuation with Twitter ultimately cost Tesla investors?

*****
> Stock futures were sharply lower Thursday following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy update, as investors worried the central bank could tip the economy into a recession as it continues its fight against inflation.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 350 points, or 1.05%. S&P 500 futures dropped 1.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1.59%.
*****
> Tesla shares fell more than 2% in the premarket after CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his stake in the company.
*****
> Treasury yields declined following the most recent Fed rate hike, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling below 3.5%.
*****
> Those moves follow a down session Wednesday when the Dow fell 142 points, while the S&P 500 declined 0.61% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.76%.
*****
> Investors digested the Federal Reserve’s latest comments following a boost to its overnight borrowing rate. The central bank said it will continue hiking rates through 2023 and projected a higher-than-expected terminal rate of 5.1%. With Wednesday’s half a percentage point hike, the targeted range for rates is currently 4.25% to 4.5%, which is the highest in 15 years.
*****
> “Overall, we expected to hear Chair Powell emphasize that the ‘hard part’ of returning inflation to 2.0% is just beginning. We largely received that message,” Bank of America’s Michael Gapen wrote in a Wednesday note.
*****
> “The Fed remains willing to risk a recession in the labor market in order to bring inflation down and, if anything, the December projections suggest that risk has risen, not diminished. We agree and continue to look for a recession in 1H 2023 and a sharper rise in the unemployment rate than the median FOMC member projects,” Gapen added.
*****
> Despite favorable improvements like modest growth, spending and production, Powell indicated he remains concerned job gains are too robust and the unemployment rate is too good for the Fed’s fight against inflation.
*****
> Investors will get another batch of economic data to digest Thursday. Retail sales, jobless claims and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index are all due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Are prices set by order books or by the NBBO?

If by NBBO, is there a limit to how many shares they could reasonably sell?

For example if they owned for some reason 20% of a company, could they realistically get this through 1 block trade at the NBBO if a Dark Pool was used?

If not, is there a way to estimate how many days a trade would take based on average volume of the stock or position size maybe?",2022-12-15 09:58:57

To disclose, I am long LCID, buying in on an earlier dip.  (Meaning I am WAY under water now.) But I could never get behind NIO.  

NIO seemed to just be a way for a holding company to generate cash for a China backed startup, a shell company really.  LCID on the other hand does hold assets.  Both of these companies are backed by governments.  Is China (or their uber rich) really going to let NIO go bankrupt?  Is the Saudi Sovern Wealth fund that has backed LCID really going to let them go bust?  

Does it seem reasonable that some ""big announcement"" is pending that would ultimately have these companies become major auto makers?

It’s max panic right now in the market. Every news outlet will have a article on the upcoming recession, fund managers are also singing how much we will be fucked in the next few quarters . 

How I see it we are already in a recession, we have passed the peak point of the recession, and coming to a recovery . The reason for it is the rising interest rate, which have to rise because of inflation. In the last 2 CPI reports, inflation has slowed significantly. Before inflation rose sharply due to the high gas price, now you can go to you local gas station and see that fuel is on a down trend. 

The fed is also slowing their interest rate rise to 0.5%. I can see an end to this high inflation issue that we are having and returning back to normal. I’m buying heavy every chance i get.

Powell’s FOMC speech all but guarantees rate cuts in 2023,0,zm3llk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zm3llk/powells_fomc_speech_all_but_guarantees_rate_cuts/,76,1671055312.0,"https://marketrebellion.com/news/trading-insights/between-the-lines-the-shockingly-dovish-news-hidden-in-powells-december-fomc-speech/

>So, when you hear the economists predicting that inflation could reach 2% by mid-year 2023, it isn’t just wishful thinking. It’s a tactful analysis on the impact a slowing economy, lagging rate hikes, recessionary fears, and a 40-year-high relative comparison (mid-year was the inflationary high of 2022).

>The bottom line: Powell saying that Fed will consider cutting rates when the Fed is confident that inflation is “moving towards 2%” is like saying, “Forget everything I said about staying the course. Forget about ‘higher for longer.’ We’re turning the money printer back on sooner than you think.”

Article makes the point that high YoY inflation comparisons will likely take us to lower CPI readings, and consequently give Powell room to cut rates.

Cunfused about ETF vs. Mutual Funds...,6,zm3jn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zm3jn4/cunfused_about_etf_vs_mutual_funds/,7,1671055199.0,"Some background on my question: Recently I have opened a Merrill Edge self-directed Roth IRA.  I am slowly adding to it.  I have had an etrade account with some stocks in it since about 2008...lots of random junk.  


I started buying into some ETFs this year.  As I have been doing this I came across ETG on my Merrill and assumed it was an ETF, based on their write up and data presented.  But. apparently it is a mutual fund.  I only bought 5 shares of it and didn't know it was a mutual fund until i reviewed my account holdings.  This surprised me because, based on google and what I can find there, a mutual fund requires a lump sum of money and is not sold as individual ""shares"" like a stock or ETF can be.  This was confirmed when I tried to buy a different lower cost mutual fund (SVAAX) in ""shares"" and the app said a minimum of $250 was needed to buy in with it. 


**So, my question is what determines when you buy a position vs buying a share? And really any clarity around ETFs vs Mutual funds.  Both are managed active or passively and I'm just lost on specifics.**


I'm not sure if I used the correct terminology in all of this.  I am not a seasoned trader, just a guy working towards a good supplement for my wife and my retirement one day in the next 20 or so years.

Why do stocks decline whenever investors think the Fed will raise rates?,17,zm03ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zm03ag/why_do_stocks_decline_whenever_investors_think/,39,1671046651.0,"If the Fed raises rates too high, then the next economic recession would be sooner and then the need to lower rates will be a little sooner instead of a little later. When the rates have to be lowered again, the price of stocks, bonds and houses would increase to return to normal levels again. Raising rates today shouldn't effect the price of stocks if you think long term.

If the Fed raises rates only enough to control inflation yet not slow the economy too much, then the Fed is doing it's job of keeping the dollar stable and doing a 'soft landing' to keep the economy from overheating yet not cause a big recession. That shouldn't have an effect on the price of stocks.

If the Fed keeps rates too low, then I think we will have more inflation that would slow the economy, turn to stagflation, cause a hard landing and then a recession.  If inflation is allowed to get completely out of control, inflation would crash the economy if we have to turn to a barter economy when a wheel barrow full of $100 dollar bills taped into bricks of money isn't enough to buy a loaf of bread. Either way, it seems the Fed keeping rates too low and the prospects of having to increase rates in the future would cause fear and the price of stocks to decline.",2022-12-14 21:37:31
Fed raises interest rates half a point to highest level in 15 years,690,zlzaim,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zlzaim/fed_raises_interest_rates_half_a_point_to_highest/,182,1671044583.0,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raises its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 15 years, indicating that the fight against inflation is not over yet despite some promising signs lately.

Keeping with expectations, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted to boost the overnight borrowing rate half a percentage point, taking it to a targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5%. The increase broke a string of four straight three-quarter point hikes, the most aggressive policy moves since the early 1980s. 

Along with the increase came an indication that officials expect to keep rates higher through next year, with no reductions until 2024. The expected “terminal rate,” or point where officials expect to end the rate hikes, was put at 5.1%, according to the FOMC’s “dot plot” of individual members’ expectations. 

The new level marks the highest the fed funds rate has been since December 2007, just ahead of the global financial crisis and as the Fed was loosening policy aggressively to combat what would turn into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. 

This time around, the Fed is raising rates into what is expected to be a moribund economy in 2023. 

Members penciled in increases for the funds rate until it hits a median level of 5.1% next year, equivalent to a target range of 5%-5.25. At that point, officials are likely to pause to allow the impact of the monetary policy tightening make its way through the economy. 

The consensus then pointed to a full percentage point worth of rate cuts in 2024, taking the funds rate to 4.1% by the end of that year. That is followed by another percentage point of cuts in 2025 to a rate of 3.1%, before the benchmark settles into a longer-run neutral level of 2.5%. 

However, there was a fairly wide dispersion in the outlook for future years, indicating that members are uncertain about what is ahead for an economy dealing with the worst inflation it has seen since the early 1980s. 

The newest dot plot featured multiple members seeing rates heading considerably higher than the median point for 2023 and 2024. For 2023, seven of the 19 committee members – voters and nonvoters included – saw rates rising above 5.25%. Similarly, there were seven members who saw rates higher than the median 4.1% in 2024.

The FOMC policy statement, approved unanimously, was virtually unchanged from November’s meeting. Some observers had expected the Fed to alter language that it sees “ongoing increases” ahead to something less committal, but that phrase remained in the statement.

Fed officials believe raising rates helps take money out the economy, reducing demand and ultimately pulling prices lower after inflation spiked to its highest level in more than 40 years.

The FOMC lowered its growth targets for 2023, putting expected GDP gains at just 0.5%, barely above what would be considered a recession. The GDP outlook for this year also was put at 0.5%. In the September projections, the committee expected 0.2% growth this year and 1.2% next.

The committee also raised its median anticipation of its favored core inflation measure to 4.8%, up 0.3 percentage points from the September outlook. Members slightly lowered their unemployment rate outlook for this year and bumped it a bit higher for the ensuing years.

The rate hike follows consecutive reports showing progress in the inflation fight.

The Labor Department reported Tuesday that the consumer price index rose just 0.1% in November, a smaller increase than expected as the 12-month rate dropped to 7.1%. Excluding food and energy, the core CPI rate was at 6%. Both measures were the lowest since December 2021. A level the Fed puts more weight on, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, fell to a 5% annual rate in October.

However, all of those readings remain well above the Fed’s 2% target. Officials have stressed the need to see consistent declines in inflation and have warned against relying too much on trends over just a few months.

Central bankers still feel they have leeway to raise rates, as hiring remains strong and consumers, who drive about two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, are continuing to spend.

Nonfarm payrolls grew by a faster than expected 263,000 in November, while the Atlanta Fed is tracking GDP growth of 3.2% for the fourth quarter. Retail sales grew 1.3% in October and were up 8.3% on an annual basis, indicating that consumers so far are weathering the inflation storm.

Inflation came about from a convergence of at least three factors: Outsized demand for goods during the pandemic that created severe supply chain issues, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that coincided with a spike in energy prices, and trillions in monetary and fiscal stimulus that created a glut of dollars looking for a place to go.

After spending much of 2021 dismissing the price increases as “transitory,” the Fed started raising interest rates in March of this year, first tentatively and then more aggressively, with the previous four increases in 0.75 percentage point increments. Prior to this year, the Fed had not raised rates more than a quarter point at a time in 22 years.

The Fed also has been engaged in “quantitative tightening,” a process in which it is allowing proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off its balance sheet each month rather than reinvesting them.

A capped total of $95 billion is being allowed to run off each month, resulting in a $332 billion decline in the balance sheet since early June. The balance sheet now stands at $8.63 trillion.

Before the CPI data was released, the market moved up 1% in the minute beforehand.

Looking into the data, it looks like the whole move came about 4 seconds before the data was released, and in these 4 seconds, the index jumped over 1%. This doesn't look like speculation, since such a move would be placing a lot of risk on the speculator, especially if they didn't know what the data would say. What makes it even more interesting is the fact that PPI had just shown higher, which would've made it more sensical for a logical speculator to bet on higher inflation.

Does anyone know from looking at twitter at the time if there was a leak, or if the release came earlier than usual? I've never known it to release earlier than 1:30pm on the dot.",2022-12-14 19:49:47

SEC charges social media influencers in alleged $100 million stock pump and dump scheme,2474,zlv66m,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zlv66m/sec_charges_social_media_influencers_in_alleged/,300,1671034771.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/sec-charges-social-media-influencers-in-alleged-100-million-fraud-scheme.html

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged seven social media influencers with using Twitter and Discord to commit securities fraud and an additional influencer with aiding and abetting the alleged $100 million scheme, the agency announced on Wednesday. The seven charged with securities fraud used the social media platforms to manipulate exchange-traded stocks in a scheme going back to at least January 2020, the SEC alleged. Through widely-followed Twitter accounts and stock trading chatrooms on Discord, the defendants allegedly “promoted themselves as successful traders,” according to an SEC press release and allegedly encouraged followers to buy stocks that they also purchased.

But they did not disclose to their followers while promoting those stocks that they allegedly planned to later sell shares once prices or trading volumes rose, according to the complaint. The influencers allegedly gained a profit by pumping the stock prices and then selling once they rose, earning about $100 million in total, the SEC claims. The eight also face criminal charges from the Department of Justice’s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas. Each of the defendants had well over 100,000 Twitter followers as of this month, the complaint states. One of those accounts, @PJ_Matlock, run by Texas resident Perry Matlock who calls himself the CEO of Atlas Trading, no longer exists as of Wednesday. The other primary defendants accused of securities fraud (and their Twitter handles) are Edward Constantin (@MrZackMorris), Thomas Cooperman (@ohheytommy), Gary Deel (@notoriousalerts), Mitchell Hennessey (@Hugh_Henne), Stefan Hrvatin (@LadeBackk) and John Rybarcyzk (@Ultra_Calls). Daniel Knight (@DipDeity) was charged with aiding and abetting the alleged scheme, in part by co-hosting a podcast that promoted some of the primary defendants as expert traders. The SEC alleged Knight also traded with the other defendants and saw profits from the scheme.

Some of the defendants’ Twitter bios include disclaimers at least as of Wednesday that appear to try to mitigate their legal risks. For example, Constantin’s account says “All my tweets are just my opinions. I’m still not a financial advisor. Parody account.” Hennessey’s says, “Everything is my opinion.I actively trade positions.Not a pro,Not Financial Advice,probably do the opposite.” Rybarcyzk’s reads “DISCLAIMER: My tweets are NOT recommendations to enter a stock. - Ideas shared on Twitter are NOT buy or sell signals. DO NOT TRADE BASED ON SOCIAL MEDIA.” Knight’s bio says, “don’t buy/sell off my tweets EVER.”",2022-12-14 18:19:31

*****
> Stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate hike decision in its effort to crush inflation.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 2 points, or less than 0.1%. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were also roughly flat.
*****
> The Fed will conclude its December meeting and is expected to deliver a 50 basis-point rate hike. That’s a smaller bump after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes. A basis point is equal to one hundredth of one percent.
*****
> Chair Jerome Powell will also speak Wednesday, giving further clues about what’s coming from the Fed in 2023. In previous meetings this year, traders have been sensitive to Powell’s language, interpreting his tone as hawkish or dovish.
*****
> “While we expect the Fed to slow the pace of rate rises at its Wednesday meeting, policymakers are likely to stress that the job of curbing inflation is not yet over,” UBS’ Mark Haefele wrote in a Wednesday note. “A slowing of job creation and wage growth will be needed before the Fed can stop hiking.”
*****
> Stocks rose for a second day Tuesday, fueled by a cooler-than-anticipated inflation report. The November consumer price index was 7.1% on the year, less than the 7.3% gain expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The 0.1% increase from the previous month was also less than forecast.
*****
> The signal that inflation may have peaked was positive for stocks as it means the Fed may be one step closer to halting interest rate hikes or switching to cuts, which would fuel equities.

"Profit driven inflation, not wage inflation?",8,zlnqp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zlnqp1/profit_driven_inflation_not_wage_inflation/,18,1671014393.0,"
I came across this article (see below) highlighting why the author thinks the Fed's rate hikes have failed to control inflation. 
I'm no economist so looking for some THOUGHTFUL insight into this as its sort of anecdotal. If inflation is driven by profits then how to curb it?
[*not sure what flair to choose]


The Fed Is Dead – OpEd
 December 14, 2022
By Robert Reich

The Fed is meeting Tuesday. Wednesday, presumably, it will raise interest rates again in its continuing attempt to stem inflation by slowing the economy.

But the Fed’s rate hikes aren’t working. Despite seven straight increases in just nine months, totaling a whopping 4.25 percentage points — a pace not seen since the Fed’s inflation fight in the 1980s — price increases are still hovering near four-decade highs.

The Fed’s rate hikes are slowing the economy, but not prices. Why not?

The Fed’s failure to stem inflation is partly due to events outside the United States — Putin’s war in Ukraine, China’s lockdown, and post-COVID demand worldwide exceeding worldwide supplies of all sorts of materials and components.

But it’s also because domestic inflation is being driven by profits, not wages. And interest rate hikes don’t reduce profit-driven inflation — at least not directly. Instead, workers and consumers take the hit.

Labor costs increased 5.3 percent over the past year. But prices rose 7.3 percent. This means the real purchasing power of American workers continues to drop.

Forget the 1970s wage-price spiral when real average earnings continued to rise for much of the decade. Now, workers are taking it on the chin.

Profits have grown faster than labor costs for seven of the past eight quarters. As Paul Donovan, chief economist for UBS’s Global Wealth Management, wrote last week, “today’s price inflation is more a product of profits than wages.”

Corporate profits surged to a record high of $2.08 trillion in the third quarter of this year, even as inflation continued to squeeze workers and consumers. Over the last two years, quarterly profits have ballooned more than 80 percent, from around $1.2 trillion to more than $2 trillion.

Executives of big companies across America continue to tell Wall Street they can keep prices high or raise them even higher. As Pepsi Co. financial chief Hugh Johnston said on his company’s third quarter earnings call, “ [we’re] capable of taking whatever pricing we need.”

Not every business is raking it in, to be sure. Most small businesses aren’t sharing in the profit bonanza because everything they need for putting stuff on the shelves has gone up in price.

But the big ones have never done as well. 

In fact, rather than slowing corporate price increases, the Fed’s rate hikes seem to be having the opposite effect.

It’s not hard to see why. If I run a big corporation, I’m not going to lower my prices and profits in the face of a pending economic slowdown. I’ll do everything I can to keep them as high as possible for as long as I can.

I’ll reduce my prices and profits only when the Fed’s higher rates begin hurting consumers enough that they stop buying stuff at my high prices because they can find better deals elsewhere.

Yet if I have a monopoly or near-monopoly — as is increasingly the case with big American corporations — my consumers won’t have much choice. If they want and need my stuff, they’ll continue to buy at the higher prices.

Of course, I’ll keep telling them I have no choice but to keep raising my prices because my costs keep increasing — even though that’s bunk because I’m increasing my profit margins.

Eventually, the Fed could raise interest rates so high that the cost of borrowing makes it impossible for consumers — whose wages, remember, are already dropping, adjusted for inflation — to afford what I’m selling, thereby forcing me to stop raising my prices.

But by this time, people will be hurting. Many will have lost economic ground. Some will have become impoverished. A large number of jobs will have been lost.

The Fed should stop believing it can easily stop profit-price inflation by hiking interest rates. It should pause interest-rate hikes long enough to see — and allow the nation to see — they’re harming workers and consumers more than corporations that continue to rake in record profits.  

The government should use other means to tame inflation. Like what?

Like windfall profits taxes as California’s governor Gavin Newsom has proposed for oil companies there, and Representative Ro Khanna and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse have proposed nationally (taxing the difference between the current price of oil per barrel and the average cost between 2015 and 2019).

Like tough antitrust enforcement aimed at reducing the pricing power of big corporations (as Lina Kahn is attempting at the Federal Trade Commission and Jonathan Kanter is trying at the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department).

Like a new antitrust law that allows enforcers to bust up big corporations (and prevent them from buying other businesses) when they’re powerful enough to continue raising their prices higher than their costs are rising. (Could Republicans in Congress be coaxed into supporting this? I believe so.)

It’s important that Americans know the truth. Seven Fed rate hikes in just nine months have barely dented corporate power to raise prices and profit margins. 

Which is why the Fed is putting the onus of fighting inflation on workers and consumers rather than on the corporations responsible for it.

This is wrong. It’s bad economics. It’s insane politics. And it’s profoundly unfair.",2022-12-14 12:39:53

I understand higher rates will deter housing and car purchases and essentially make them more expensive. Is that alone enough to reduce economic activity? Basically the banks will eat the wage growth with interest and that will result in a depressed GDP? Is that enough to cause a significant recession and if so what historically makes people think that?  How much would those two sectors drive GDP down?",2022-12-14 07:36:42

Lessons From Trading Risky Volatile Sticks,35,zlht7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zlht7i/lessons_from_trading_risky_volatile_sticks/,23,1670993331.0,"Hey everyone, I've spent several years trading volatile risky stocks and I've learned a few lessons along the way. I would like to share them here in case they may be useful to you.

Now before I begin, I want to make it clear that I'm not promoting any particular stock. Nor do I encourage anyone to trade risky volatile stocks. Your best bet is to consistently invest in a total market index fund like VTI and forget about it. If you must invest in individual stocks, invest in safe blue chip stocks like Apple or Amazon.

If you do invest in risky volatile stocks, realize that you can very well lose all your money. This isn't a joke or a game. Take it seriously. I'm sharing what I learned so you can hopefully minimize your risks and maximize your gains.

I don't own any BBBY shares now but I did own many of them earlier this year. In fact, I invested my entire life savings into BBBY shares. I bought at the right time, in late July-early August 2022. I ended up buying around 5000 BBBY shares and my total cost basis was $45,000. This represented my entire life savings as I don't have a 401k or IRA account. So you can imagine that I took on a fair amount of risk by investing my entire life savings in 1 stock. I did it because I wanted to swing trade and make a lot of money.

Now as you may be aware, BBBY share price went up by a lot in August 2022. On August 17th, my 5000 BBBY shares were worth $150,000. Yes, that's right. I had made $105,000 in unrealized gains. Unfortunately, like a greedy fool, I didn't sell. I wanted that $150,000 to reach $500,000 before I sold my BBBY shares. Yes, I was greedy and foolish and paid the price.

This brings me to my first lesson:

**Always take profit when you're in the green.**

You will never be able to time the top so don't even try. Remember, it's better to take some profit then to take none. If your unrealized gains is good enough for you to want to take a screenshot and send to your friends and family, then it's good enough for you to sell and realize those gains. Never forget that. Always sell when you're in the green. Don't be greedy and try to time the top so you can maximize gains.

My second lesson is:

**When you're in the green, at least sell enough shares so that you've covered your cost basis. That way, you're left playing with house money.**

This is a huge one. Cover your cost basis. If I had sold enough BBBY shares to cover my 45k cost basis, I would be in a much better financial situation now. Instead, I was greedy and decided to keep holding so I could make more gains. The best part of doing this is the relief you feel after your cost basis is covered. You know then that you're just playing with house money and even if you lose everything, it's ok because it's house money, not your initial money invested.

Like a naive greedy fool, I held on to my BBBY shares as the share price went down. I could have sold for a huge profit but I decided to keep holding. However, to my credit, I did sell all 5000 of my BBBY shares on Friday, September 2nd 2022 for $8.50 a share. In hindsight, that was a great decision because the BBBY share price kept slowly going down since then and the share price ended under $3 today, Tuesday, December 13th 2022. If I had kept holding those shares and not sold, I would have lost almost 30 thousand dollars.

This takes me to my third lesson:

**Be ready to exit your position, even at a loss, if you feel you will incur more losses by holding on to your position. It's better to take a small loss than a big loss.**

I really didn't want to sell my 5000 BBBY shares. I was hoping that the BBBY shares will go up in price like it did in August. However after analyzing the situation, I realized that the future didn't look bright for BBBY and it would be better I sold and took a $2500 loss rather than holding on to my shares and taking a much bigger loss. Looking back, I sure am glad I sold.

There was another reason why I sold and that's opportunity cost. After analyzing BBBY, I realized that even if the BBBY share price doesn't go down, it will most likely just stagnate and not make me any gains. It would be better to sell my BBBY shares and buy shares of a more promising stock which would make me more gains. That's what I did and it brings me to my fourth lesson:

**In addition to financial gain and losses, always consider opportunity costs and the value of your time. Even if a particular stock doesn't make you lose money, if it doesn't give you gains, then consider the opportunity cost. Consider what you're missing out on by tying your money into this particular stock that isn't taking you anywhere.**

The fifth lesson I learned is that even if your entry point to a particular stock isn't great i.e. you buy in at a high price and the share price subsequently drops, you can improve your cost basis by selling covered calls. This is especially useful for volatile stocks since they tend to have high implied volatility (IV) which usually means higher covered call premiums.

My fifth lesson is therefore:

**Consider selling covered calls to reduce your cost basis and generate some income, especially if you own a lot of shares of a particular stock.**

I'm not going to describe how to sell a covered call here because this post is long enough already but google and youtube will help you there.

Now I've been using BBBY as an example but these lessons are applicable to any risky volatile stock that you decide to trade with. I've traded several different risky stocks such as AMC, Palantir etc. in the past and the lessons I described above are applicable to all of them.

Anyway, that's it guys. I hope this is of some use to you. Please DM me if you have questions and I'll do my best to help. I know that none of the lessons I'm sharing are amazing secrets or anything like that. It's mostly common sense but many rookie traders forget to apply them. I wish someone had taught me these lessons before I started trading stocks which is why I made this post.",2022-12-14 06:48:51

Tesla Investors Voice Concern Over Elon Musk’s Focus on Twitter,1647,zlf435,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zlf435/tesla_investors_voice_concern_over_elon_musks/,499,1670985601.0,"The chorus of Tesla Inc. individual investors expressing misgivings that Chief Executive Elon Musk‘s involvement with Twitter Inc. may be to the detriment of the electric-vehicle maker is getting louder, with the car company’s stock on track for its worst full-year performance.  

“There is no TSLA CEO today,” Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund LLC, which owns roughly $50 million worth of Tesla, tweeted Monday. 

Mr. Black voiced frustration after another sharp selloff in Tesla’s stock Monday. Shares in the world’s largest car company by market value fell more than 6% in Monday trading after a tumultuous weekend for Mr. Musk on Twitter, including the billionaire taking aim at the company’s former head of trust and safety; calling for the prosecution of top U.S. government medical adviser Anthony Fauci; and criticizing people who offer their pronouns without being asked.

Mr. Black said, “The market voted today that the $TSLA brand has been negatively impacted by the Twitter drama. Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends or show off Teslas in their driveways, now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla’s brand equity.”

Ross Gerber, a longtime backer of Tesla, on Monday tweeted a question directed at Tesla’s board of directors. “Who is running tesla day to day during this critical time for the company,” Mr. Gerber said. 

He separately tweeted, “There is nothing wrong at tesla at all. Other than the CEO working at another company, certainly tesla deserves a focused ceo. It would be helpful to know what Elon’s plans are.”

Mr. Musk, at a trial about his Tesla compensation package last month, said he had been spending most of his time of late focusing on Twitter, which he acquired for $44 billion. “I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,” he testified. 

Tesla shares are down 54.31% this year through Tuesday’s close, putting it on pace for their worst year on record. The only other year where the shares fell was in 2016, when Tesla’s stock ended down 10.97%. The Nasdaq, which advanced Tuesday, has fallen around 28% this year.

Tesla shares closed down 4.09% Tuesday, the day Mr. Musk ceded the unofficial title to European mogul Bernard Arnault for the world’s wealthiest individual, according to Bloomberg, which publishes a ranking of the richest people.

Mr. Musk’s takeover of Twitter has raised anxiety among Tesla backers for months. Several urged the Tesla CEO to abandon the deal and focus on the car maker, when shares were already down around 30%. The stock has declined further in ensuing months amid growing recession concerns and cost pressure from high inflation. Tesla also has scaled back vehicle delivery plans. Tesla’s stock has fallen about 28% since the Twitter deal closed in late October through Tuesday, when it ended trading at its lowest level in more than two years.

The Tesla boss on Tuesday tweeted: “Tesla will be great long-term, but doesn’t control macroeconomic tides.” He later added “I will make sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term,” but didn’t offer details.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk last week said he continues to work on Tesla as well as SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp. “I continue to oversee both Tesla & SpaceX, but the teams there are so good that often little is needed from me,” he tweeted Saturday.

Bill Nelson, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s administrator, said Sunday that he had asked SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell if Mr. Musk’s purchase of the social-media platform would divert from the rocket company’s mission. Mr. Nelson said he was given assurance that wouldn’t be the case.

Leo KoGuan, a self-proclaimed Tesla investor, last week tweeted: “Tesla board is missing in action” and called on the company to initiate a share buyback. Mr. Black also has been urging the company to pursue a $10 billion share repurchase. 

Mr. Musk in October said Tesla could pursue a $5 billion to $10 billion share buyback and said some meaningful buyback was likely. The company had discussed such a share repurchase at the board level, but at the time hadn’t signed off on it. Mr. Musk has sold more than $19 billion in Tesla stock this year, including almost $4 billion in November to help finance Twitter. 

Tesla’s brand image has taken a hit in recent months, according to market surveys. Self-identifying Democrats in particular have soured on the car maker since Mr. Musk bought Twitter, according to data from research firm Morning Consult.

I've done a little bit of development on QuantConnect, IAB, etc. Each had things I didn't like about them.

Ideally, this script would run on a little little box (like a raspberry pi) and would just be light and seldomly have to be maintained.

I've ran into a few scenarios where the API changed and I essentially had to start over, which I'm trying to avoid or make it a very rare occurence.

Why isn't low inflation is not moving stocks? The pivot is confusing? Maybe this will help,3,zlam1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zlam1b/why_isnt_low_inflation_is_not_moving_stocks_the/,26,1670974057.0,"This is how I think about ""the pivot"", or interest rate hikes generally.

There are 4 main baskets where money can be stored: Equities (stocks), Debt (bonds), Cash, and Real estate (land/rentals). There are others.. commodities, FX, artwork... but these are the big pieces of the pie.

If inflation is slowing down, it's the expectation of wall street that the Fed will slow down interest rate hikes and at some point soon, perhaps stop altogether. According to government measurements, inflation is slowing down lately - a lot. This tracks with what I see when I go to Walmart/etc. Retailers are really starting to pump up the promotions to move inventory. Gas prices are not far from where they were pre-pandemic (inflation adjusted). Rents are beginning to adjust down as people renew leases. Houses are sitting on the market much longer.

If interest rate hikes are getting closer to the apex yield, it's no different from a stock market rout where equities are getting near as cheap as they will get. ***High bond yields mean it's expensive to be a borrower, but great to be a lender. The same way equity offers the best return when it is purchased cheapest.***

So when comparing bond yields to stock yields, if a person is expecting the bond yield is nearing it's peak, *that's the time institutional money is going to start shifting into bonds* and out of something else.

What is the something else? Considering the state of things, probably a mix of real estate and equities. In specific, the lowest yielding (most expensive) equities. Real estate is likely to be a lot slower, as it's not so fast and easy to sell.

So as long as bonds are expected to continue rising for a while yet, I don't expect any big stock rout. At least not because of bonds. Why would there be? Who wants to lock in a 10yr 3% treasury if a 4% treasury is just over the horizon?

When the fed signals they will stop hiking, that's when I would expect an influx out of the expensive equities and into the longer term bonds. If and when the fed eventually backs off and begins tapering, those peak bonds near the pivot will be more valuable than what can be purchased subsequently.

Those bonds are also sold on the secondary market, and a 4% treasury is more valuable when rates are falling and the only thing available from primary sales is a 3%.

Anybody who was lucky or smart enough to buy a bunch of long dated Treasuries in 1981 got to enjoy bond coupons nobody has had access to in US Treasuries since. But at the time there was no telling how high rates were going to have to go, or how long they'd have to stay near that peak. The fed spent most of the 80's figuring it out.

Like all things macro, there's a million factors, all relative to and acting on one another. No telling how they all interact. The best we can do is make generalized guesses and expect to be at least somewhat wrong.

Clear as mud, yeah?",2022-12-14 01:27:37
"Inflation coming in lighter than expected is likely to be a Bearish indicator, especially in the short term",15,zl9nx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zl9nx0/inflation_coming_in_lighter_than_expected_is/,59,1670971822.0,"**Edit:** Down votes are totally fair for this opinion. I was just hoping to get some contrarian views as well. 

For all of 2022, the Fed has been doing their best to increase rates to try and get inflation under control. It looks like we're starting to make some progress as inflation is slowing as seen by today's report and to some degree, the past few reports.

Markets Rejoice!

But not so fast. A reduction in the month to month inflation is great and something that in the long run will be good. But what does inflation coming in below expectations mean for stocks?

A lower rate of inflation means that there are either less than expected dollars chasing the same amount of things, or it could mean there are more things out there with the same amount of dollars. Either way, it means that some or all companies could see less revenue increases or even lower revenue than estimated if we start to see deflation throughout the economy.

If the above happens, we'll start to see the next leg down in the market as earnings compress. I obviously don't have a crystal and can't say for certain it will happen but based on the Fed's actions, I personally think we haven't gotten out of this bear market quite yet.

Here are the reasons why I think we're likely to see that happen next:

1. Real average hourly earnings increased only .5% MoM and are DOWN 1.9% YoY (per the CPI report
2. Food prices rose .5% MoM and are up 10.6% YoY (I would argue this is a good that is not super elastic)
3. Shelter costs are up .6% MoM (again, I would argue this is not a super elastic good)
4. The price of goods like used cars is down 2.9% MoM and services like medical services cost declined .7% MoM.

All that is to say that we're starting to see people making less, spend less on goods and services, while continuing to spend more on goods that they HAVE TO spend on, ie shelter and food; potentially giving them even less disposable income to spend on other things.

Furthermore, from Powell's last FOMC speech, he made it clear that the markets are not fully pricing in how high rate hikes could go and that they are not likely to stop/reduce them anytime soon.

In my opinion, only when we start to see the unemployment rate go up markedly can we assume that the bear market is likely at the end, as the fed stops and reduces rates and companies start to increase their earnings again.

In the mean time, I've been continuing to add tech, especially the big boys such as aapl, amzn, googl, etc. I don't how much further we fall or if we even fall at all but I do think Big Tech is still the way of the future.

With that said, I think whatever recession and earnings decline we see will be mild to moderate as far as stocks are concerned due to many of the big player's strength coming out of covid.

misconceptions about inflation,5,zl1e5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zl1e5u/misconceptions_about_inflation/,32,1670952542.0,"There seems to be a lot of misconceptions about inflation, especially amongst inexperienced traders. After seeing posts like ""illogical market thinks 7.1% is good"" or """"7.1% inflation is still too high"", I am convinced people don't understand or even read the reports and are just reading articles citing the YoY headline inflation stat.

Looking at YoY inflation is misleading, I will give you an example. Imagine inflation jumped by 7% MoM from January to February of 2023. Now imagine prices decline by 0.1% each month after that until February of 2024. No economist in 2024 would say that inflation is a problem.  To the contrary, they would say we are experiencing deflation. But apparently these headline citing inexperienced traders would not.

In this example YoY inflation in February of 2024 would read almost 6%. You would draw the wrong conclusion by looking at surface level statistics like this YoY headline CPI and therefore you'd think we are currently experiencing high inflation.

A more accurate measure is looking at MoM inflation or at least annualizing the last couple months of MoM inflation data.",2022-12-13 19:29:02
I am so stupid and it worked,105,zl1bvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zl1bvj/i_am_so_stupid_and_it_worked/,50,1670952391.0,"I bought 235 shares of UPRO yesterday (triple leveraged S&P 500 ETF) at 36.49$. This morning, I turned on my computer right before the CPI number release to see it live. I work in finance, so I have access to FactSet.

&#x200B;

I swear, I saw the Factset print ""CPI hotter than expected +0.3%; Core CPI +0.1%"". OMG, what an horrible news. I check the S&P 500 futures + my UPRO position and it is up! Still under panick thinking it will crash at any time, I call my broker to place a pre-market sell order. Yes, I am in Canada and I can only do pre-market orders over the phone (and the commission cost me 48$). One thing you also have to consider, I cannot do my trades whenever I want. My employer gets my trades on a repport, and I must trade before/after work, or during my breaks (15min), or during my lunch (30min). So I am limited in time reaction. Anyway, I sold my UPRO shares at 39.74$ for a good gain considering I held the position for less than 24 hours.

&#x200B;

Then, right before work, I check the news on FactSet to see inflation was cooler than expected. My UPRO stock opened at 40.46$. I told myself how stupid I am. I would have kept my position knowing CPI came cooler. I can swear the God I saw the print at 8:30am saying inflation came hotter than expected. Now the market cooled down from the high opening, UPRO is currently trading under 38$, and looks like I did a good move somehow.",2022-12-13 19:26:31

Nuclear fusion breakthrough - where and how to invest,5,zkyfnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zkyfnw/nuclear_fusion_breakthrough_where_and_how_to/,21,1670945313.0,"A 70-year-long effort to harness nuclear fusion reactions to generate unlimited clean energy is finally taking shape. For the first time in history, U.S. government scientists have generated more energy from a controlled reaction than it consumed.

The breakthrough was achieved at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory last Tuesday after successfully simulating the solar reactions.

The net energy gain that the experiment achieved paves the way for an abundant supply of reliable, clean, and sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel. If regularly achieved, net energy gains can curb climate change (if not reverse it in the very long term), oil sector-induced inflation can be tamed, and the world can eventually be weaned off its dependence on fossil fuels. (Deep dive: [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/4b6f0fab-66ef-4e33-adec-cfc345589dc7))

# The stock angle

This has been an achievement decades in the making because nuclear fusion has the potential to create energy to power the world without producing carbon or radioactive waste. The road ahead will still be long before this technology becomes commercially viable, but for those in it for the long game, here's a look at how the breakthrough can benefit publicly traded companies like Chevron (**CVX**) and Amazon (**AMZN**). 

>One of the world’s largest energy companies, Chevron, has made several significant investments in the area of clean energy. In this regard, the company started the Chevron Technology Ventures investment fund, which allocates its investments to several low-carbon energy resources. The fund presently has 10 investments in several innovative energy technologies.  
>  
>  
The fund’s investment in Zap Energy, a company that is developing nuclear fusion-related technology, can provide Chevron’s investors significant exposure to this area. Moreover, its investment plans in expanding its hydrogen capabilities also speak of its commitment to improving clean energy.  
>  
>  
Apart from its investments in clean energy, Chevron’s practical capital spending strategies and cost control measures can fuel solid long-term growth. Strong cash flow generating capability allows the company to up its oil production level, reduce its debt, and enhance shareholder value. Chevron is well-positioned to grow in the conventional oil and energy sector as much as it is when clean energy starts getting commercialized.

**Chevron is rated** [HOLD by 12/13 WSJ analysts](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CVX/research-ratings) **and consensus of Overweight**

>At first glance, Amazon seems to be an unusual choice of stock when it comes to the process of nuclear fusion. However, diving deeper, technology is a very intricately interconnected marvel; and being one of the biggest tech giants, very few technological advancements can escape Amazon’s investments.  
>  
>  
Companies dabbling in nuclear fusion directly are looking forward to creating functional reactors in the next few years. Although it’s likely that nuclear fusion technology commercialization won’t happen until the end of the decade, one of the industries that might be among the first to jump on the bandwagon is data centers.  
>  
>  
Data centers run on high amounts of power because of the sheer volume of data that forms the backbone of tech. For that reason, data centers are found in less-populated areas and already have the infrastructure to support new generators; thus ticking two important boxes for placing a nuclear reactor (the phrase “data is the new oil” now makes sense).  
>  
>  
Now, Amazon already has billions invested in its AWS data centers and is continuing to expand its footprint in this market. In this case, it will not come as a surprise if Amazon, given its remarkable resources, adopts nuclear fusion technology to improve its cost efficiency and revenues.

**Amazon has a** [consensus rating of BUY](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN/research-ratings) **by WSJ analysts**

# [Stock futures rise as investors await key November inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street braced for November’s key inflation report and the beginning of the Federal Reserve December policy meeting.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 197 points, or 0.57%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.53% and 0.55%, respectively.
*****
> Investors are looking ahead to the release of November’s consumer price index report, and hoping for signs of easing inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 0.3% increase on a monthly basis or an annual pace of 7.3%. That would be a step down from October’s 0.4% monthly increase and annual gain of 7.7%.
*****
> Tuesday’s inflation report could play a key role in the Federal Reserve’s next rate-hiking decision expected at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.
*****
> Traders are largely pricing in a 50 basis point increase, a slight decline from the previous four hikes. They will also monitor updated economic projections and commentary out of Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference for signs of a potential policy pivot as fears of a recession linger on Wall Street.
*****
> Monday’s overnight moves follow a solid session for all the major averages after a tough down week. The Dow gained more than 528 points, or 1.58%, while the S&P and Nasdaq rose 1.43% and 1.26%, respectively.
*****
> All S&P 500 sectors finished with gains, led to the upside by energy stocks, which rose as oil prices gained.
*****
> “I think this is a reflection of what’s anticipated out of the CPI number tomorrow, and a hope that the Fed will confirm a 50 basis point raise on Wednesday,” said Kevin Philip, partner at Bel Air Investment Advisors.
*****
> “I think the market, as it’s done before, is banking, in my opinion, a little too heavily on some sort of Fed pivot and this bounce we got today is fragile at best.”

* Billionaire John Paulson's family office is set to make $500 million from its stake in Horizon Therapeutics, Forbes said Monday. 
* Paulson & Co. has held a stake in the biotech company since 2017. 
* Amgen plans to buy Horizon in a $27.8 billion deal. 

 Billionaire John Paulson's firm, known for betting against subprime mortgages during the global financial crisis, stands to make $500 million from investing in Horizon Therapeutics[,](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/hznp-stock?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) [according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2022/12/12/billionaire-john-paulson-stands-to-make-500-million-from-horizons-sale-to-amgen/?sh=f690d1c75dca), as the biotech firm gets scooped up by [Amgen.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amgn-stock?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) 

[Horizon](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/hznp-stock?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets), which specializes in finding treatments for rare and autoimmune diseases, will be taken over by Amgen in a [$27.8 billion acquisition](https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/12/rule-2-7-announcement-amgen-inc-to-acquire-horizon-therapeutics-plc). Amgen said Monday it will pay $116.50 a share in cash, a nearly 20% premium to Horizon's closing price of $97.29 on December 9. 

Paulson & Co. is set to take about $520 million before taxes on the deal, Forbes estimated, based on publicly disclosed information. Forbes cited FactSet data in saying the firm has owned a stake in Horizon since 2017, with an estimate Paulson paid an average of about $31 for 6.1 million shares. 

Horizon was the firm's largest disclosed holding, the report said, citing regulatory filings.

""Its an important position for us,"" Paulson told Forbes in emailed comments. ""Excellent outcome for both companies.""

Paulson & Co. is widely known for making $15 billion by shorting the US housing market at the peak of the credit bubble in 2007. The firm transitioned from a hedge fund to a family office in 2020 and now primarily invests John [Paulson's fortune, which Forbes estimates](https://www.forbes.com/profile/john-paulson/?sh=4d672183418d) at roughly $3 billion.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Is this area beween 32-35 a buy for ARKK if you are already in the stock.  If you are already own ARKK and bought it in tripple digits (ouch), is this the time to avg down.  I understand that avg down shouldnt be just to avg down a holding if its a bad stock.  One should look at the new money as separate investment and see if it makes sense to invest in the stock at these levels.  Yes.

If recession is coming, interest rates are likely going to pause or turn over.  Could these levels be good to step in for ARKK ?

Tomorrow is a big day and we shall see what happens with CPI.  Fed not so much because they are just going to come out and do 50, but they will still move the market.

If CPI is good and soft number than we shall rally for a bit till JP comes out and smashes those hopes.  But we could rally through the end of the year if the CPI is softer than expected.

But what if CPI meets expectation or is hotter than expected.  The market is going to sell of and then will start a dump to 3600 again and if that happens potentially down to 3200 after the earnings season.

But in short term, if the CPI number is hot tomorrow, how to play the market.  What are the stocks to short ?  Some might say that the time to make that trade was today and not tomorrow.  I guess you might be right.  But lets say that for folks who didnt do that, what are their best options tomorrow after a hot CPI report.

I have never really shorted the market.  Mostly whenever I feel bearish, I have just bought puts or sold calls.  But never short shares.

So if I wanted to short shares, what do you think is the best opportunity out there for a hotter than expected CPI ? Which charts are setup for a great technical short as well as hotter CPI will add fuel to the fire ?  Whats your suggestion ?",2022-12-13 02:13:45

However, on the securities side, I am holding the remaining positions I had since cashing out and am accumulating cash.  I have a lot more time to do other things but am tempted to start trading again just to have something challenging to do.

"‘There is a slowdown happening’ – Wells Fargo, BofA CEOs point to cooling consumer amid Fed hikes",19,zk2fqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zk2fqv/there_is_a_slowdown_happening_wells_fargo_bofa/,5,1670859620.0," 

American consumers are tapping the brakes on spending as the Federal Reserve's [interest rate increases](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/fed-chair-jerome-powell-says-smaller-rate-hikes-could-come-in-december.html) reverberate throughout the economy, according to the CEOs of two of the largest American banks.

After two years of pandemic-fueled, double-digit growth in [Bank of America](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAC/) card volume, ""the rate of growth is slowing,"" CEO [Brian Moynihan](https://www.cnbc.com/brian-moynihan/) said Tuesday at a financial conference. While retail payments surged 11% so far this year to nearly $4 trillion, that increase obscures a slowdown that began in recent weeks: November spending rose just 5%, he said.

It was a similar story at rival [Wells Fargo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WFC/), according to CEO [Charlie Scharf,](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/at-wells-fargo-a-jamie-dimon-protege-finally-takes-over-a-big-us-bank.html) who cited shrinking growth in credit-card spending and roughly flat debit card transaction volumes.

 The bank leaders, with their bird's eye view of the U.S. economy, are providing evidence that the Fed's campaign to subdue inflation by raising borrowing costs is beginning to impact consumer behavior. Fortified by pandemic stimulus checks, wage gains and low unemployment, American consumers have [supported the economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/17/bank-of-america-ceo-brian-moynihan-says-the-us-consumer-is-healthy.html), but that appears to be changing. That will have [implications](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/recession-walmart-jpmorgan-gm-ceos-talk-about-possible-slowdown.html) for corporate profits as businesses navigate 2023. 

 

""There is a slowdown happening, there's no question about it,"" Scharf said. ""We are expecting a fairly weak economy throughout the entire year, and hopeful that it'll be somewhat mild relative to what it could possibly be.""

Both CEOs said they expect a recession in 2023. Bank of America's Moynihan said he expects three quarters of negative growth next year followed by a slight uptick in the fourth quarter.

 

But, in a divergence that has implications for the coming months, the downturn isn't being felt equally across retail customers and businesses so far, according to the Wells Fargo CEO.

""We have seen certainly more stress on the lower-end consumer than on the upper end,"" Scharf said. In terms of the companies served by Wells Fargo, ""there are some that are doing quite well and there's some that are struggling.""

[Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/airlines-will-return-to-profitability-in-2023-after-three-year-slump-iata.html), cruise providers and other experience or entertainment-based industries are faring better than those involved in durable goods, he said. That sentiment was echoed by Moynihan, who cited strong travel spending.

""People bought a lot of goods, exercised a lot of the freedom they had in discretionary spend over the last couple of years, and those purchases are slowing,"" Scharf said. ""You're seeing significant shifts to things like travel and restaurants and entertainment and some of the things that people want to do.""

The slowdown is the ""intended outcome"" that's desired by the Fed as it seeks to tame inflation, Moynihan noted.

But the central bank has a tricky balancing act to pull off: raising rates enough to slow the economy, while hopefully avoiding a harsh downturn. Many market forecasters expect the Fed's benchmark rate to hit about 5% next year, though some think higher rates will be needed.

""You're starting to see that \[slowdown\] take hold,"" Moynihan said. ""The real question will be how soon they have to stabilize that in order to avoid more damage; that's the question that's on the table.""",2022-12-12 17:40:20

"Stock Market’s Defining Moment Arrives With CPI, Fed Decision",35,zk21up,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zk21up/stock_markets_defining_moment_arrives_with_cpi/,31,1670858750.0," It’s the week everyone’s been waiting for. With the release a key measure of inflation, the Federal Reserve interest-rate decision and Chair Jerome Powell’s comments afterward, investors are hoping to finally have a clear view of what’s ahead for a beaten-down stock market and economy in 2023.

But after a tumultuous year that has the S&P 500 Index looking at its biggest annual loss since 2008, equity traders are prepared for one sure thing over the coming sessions: more volatility.

Inflation reports have been rocking equities all year, leaving markets to gauge the central bank’s likely policy path amid relentlessly surging prices. This week’s consumer price index reading is crucial, as signs of ebbing inflation could buoy shares into year-end by tempering expectations for further Fed hikes.

Over the past six months, the S&P 500 has seen an average move of about 3% in either direction on the day CPI has been released, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest since 2009. The S&P 500 has fallen on seven of the 11 CPI reporting days this year.

The US central bank is widely expected to deliver a half-point hike at the close of its meeting on Dec. 14. So equity investors are more focused on what Powell has to say at his press conference afterward, looking for any hints on the path forward for interest rates. The Fed’s outlook for the US economy will also be a focus, along with any changes in central bankers’ rate projections.",2022-12-12 17:25:50

# [Stock futures nudge higher to start the week with Fed meeting, key inflation data on deck](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/11/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close-live-updates.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures were fractionally higher early Monday ahead of a week with several anticipated events in the ongoing fight against inflation.
*****
> Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 50 points, or 0.15%. Those for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 edged 0.2% and 0.26% higher, respectively.
*****
> The move in futures comes as investors will be focused on inflation this week. On Tuesday, the November consumer price index will be released, and traders will be looking for a sign that inflation is slowing.
*****
> The Federal Reserve has a two-day meeting starting the same day. The central bank is expected to announce another rate hike on Wednesday, though traders are anticipating a smaller move than in recent months.
*****
> In addition to the expected rate hike, the Fed’s updated economic projections and Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference could be key signals for what the central bank wants to do in the coming months.
*****
> “Financial conditions have eased dramatically since the October CPI reading released last month, so the Fed will likely use the December FOMC meeting to walk those back,” said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Wealth. “We think the markets are too sanguine on rates after the first quarter and we expect Powell to take a more hawkish tone and for the dots to indicate higher rates for a longer period of time than what is currently being priced in by the futures markets.”
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a rocky week that saw all three major averages lose ground. The Dow fell 2.77% for its worst week since September. The S&P 500 dropped 3.37%, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 3.99%.

What are dividends?,2,zjb902,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zjb902/what_are_dividends/,24,1670796210.0,"I am sure that the people on r/stocks are not the average investor, people on here go above and beyond the average person, taking investing from something most people do not think about, to something we spend our leisure time discussing. Hence, why I am making this post. I see all too often, both on YouTube and on various investing subs, the misrepresentation of dividends due to a lack of understanding what a dividend is. In this post I will provide the basic fundamentals of what dividends are, along with my own opinion regarding the misstatements I see. 

&#x200B;

Since this is the internet, I feel the need to clarify that when I say dividends, I do mean cash dividends. 

&#x200B;

To begin this post let me first ask you, what is stock? When you purchase shares of a company, you are purchasing a small piece of that company, thus making you a shareholder, or a small owner in the business. 

&#x200B;

Now what is a dividend and where does it come from? When a company decides to declare a dividend, on the declaration date a liability account called ""Dividends Payable,"" is opened up. Conversely, on the payment date, the account is paid out to the shareholders (aka you and everyone else). So you might be asking yourself, ""ok, where does the cash come from, and why do I care?"" Well, this cash comes from the retained earnings (part of stockholder's equity) and cash on the balance sheet. For those that do not know, retained earnings is the equity generated by net income. This is the money that can be reinvested back into the company, buybacks, distributed to shareholders via dividends, etc. 

&#x200B;

Example: A company declares a $50 dividend; it would look something like this:

Cash (-50)

Retained Earnings (-50)

&#x200B;

I think it is also important to note that dividends do not impact the income statement. Yes, dividends are an expense, but they are not expenses that are tied to operations nor the generation of revenues. For this reason, voluntary distributions, such as dividends, are removed from the retained earnings. 

&#x200B;

Ok,  understand I probably just put you to sleep, but hopefully you are thinking, ""why are you typing all this?"" I typed all this to explain that the money you receive is not free money. The cash you receive in your brokerage account does not manifest itself from nothing, but rather it came from the company's retained earnings. 

&#x200B;

The next question I want you to ask yourself is: ""If you had $100 in your pocket, and you spent $10. Do you still have $100 of value in your pocket?"" (Yes, I am aware this is a simplification, but feel free to add multiples, and complicate it if you please. So long as $1=$1, my math rings true.) 

&#x200B;

The answer should be a resounding, ""no."" This is true for companies as well. On the ex-date of the dividend, the share price drops by the value of the dividend. This is a fact. In fact, this phenomenon occurs 100% of the time without failure. ""Why?"" you might be asking yourself. Well, the investor you sell your share to is not entitled to that dividend, and the company has made a commitment to disperse that cash off its balance sheet to the owner of the share. So why would someone pay more for less? They don't. 

&#x200B;

Now let's look at if dividends are always good. For this section I would highly encourage you to read: [Warren Buffett's 2012 Letter to Shareholders; pp. 20-21](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2012ltr.pdf). This is because it is basically what I would have typed out myself. So rather than listening to some random person on the internet, you can read the words/logic of Buffett and debate against him. The short answer is no, dividends are not always the best choice for a company, but sometimes in certain cases it can be. 

&#x200B;

To finally end this post, let's me share my opinion on dividend irrelevancy, arguably the most divisive topic on the investing subs of Reddit. First let me explain what this theory is, because I see many of its deniers misrepresent it. The irrelevance of dividends explains that an investor should have no preference between cash received from a dividend versus cash received from selling shares. It is NOT saying that dividends are not important to overall returns, and it is NOT saying that companies should not pay dividends. In short, a dividend does not add value to the company. 

&#x200B;

I am a firm believer of this theory, hopefully as you read my post you can understand why that is. First and most importantly, a company cannot remove value without losing value (aka, money cannot be created out of air), and that value is lost on the ex-date without fail. The only way for the company to maintain its current valuation, while simultaneously shrinking shareholder's equity is to change how that company is valued. I do acknowledge that most cases the dividends relative to the share prices are so small that it can go unnoticed due to the stocks volatility, however this does not mean the occurrence does not happen. If you would like an obvious example, turn to special dividends. On 11/16/2020, Costco declared a special dividend of $10 per share. On 11/30/2020, COST closed on $391.77/share, and on 12/1/2020 (the ex-date), COST opened at $384.50/share. (Not exactly $10 because of volatility but you can see the drop due to the $10 dividend) Furthermore, I will follow-up with the classic example to illustrate why investors should remain irrelevant to cash from a dividend versus cash from selling shares. 

&#x200B;

Suppose we have two companies both valued exactly the same at $100,000, both companies have the same growth, cashflows, etc. The only difference being that company Y pays a $1 dividend per share. Shares of company X and Y are both $10 a share, and you own 100 shares. 

&#x200B;

With company X, we decide to sell 10 shares, and in return we receive $100 cash. This leaves us with $100 cash, and $900 still invested in company X.

&#x200B;

With company Y, on the ex-date, their stock falls to $9/share and later we are paid $100 in dividends. We are left with $100 cash and $900 still invested in company Y.  

&#x200B;

Now, this is where many people claim company Y has the advantage because you did not have to sell shares. Well, the best way to measure your returns is the overall value of your position, not through the number of shares you own, and I will illustrate that for you below. The only benefit of company Y is you own a higher percentage of company Y after the transaction. However, since you just read Buffett's letter to shareholders, you know why that is not always the best option.

&#x200B;

(100 shares x $9/share) = (90 shares x $10/share)

&#x200B;

Now some positives words about dividends. I do like that dividends keep people interested and excited about investing, if this is you, then keep on investing! But realize the truth about dividends; it is not free money. Yes, reinvesting your dividends does increase returns, same if you sold 3% of your portfolio every year and did not reinvest the cash, you would experience a reduction in your returns too. 

&#x200B;

Widespread economic uncertainty has made debt investors less willing to buy the bonds these nontraditional lenders issue. Higher interest rates, courtesy of the Federal Reserve, have given investors other attractive options.

Now, ***these finance companies are paying as much as four times what they paid in January to borrow in bond markets the cash they lend to customers.*** Plenty of them are struggling to make that math work. Once-highflying consumer-finance companies such as Pagaya Technologies have flipped from profit to loss. Some smaller outfits are shutting down altogether.

***Many of the nontraditional lenders launched within the past decade, which means they have never weathered a sustained period of high interest rates.***

***“All of these fintech firms talk about their data science and machine learning capabilities, but the truth is, their models have not been battle tested through a recession yet,”*** said Reggie Smith, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s lead fintech stock analyst.

Pagaya and other startups such as Affirm Holdings Inc. and Carvana Co. aren’t banks, which means they can’t take deposits for funding. For borrowers with imperfect credit, these alternative lenders are sometimes the only way to get an auto loan, mortgage or buy-now-pay-later offer.

The companies are now lending less or charging more for loans they do make, adding to concerns already swirling about the health of the economy.

Athas Capital Group, an alternative mortgage lender in Calabasas Hills, Calif., announced its closure in November, citing the poor outlook for selling its loans to Wall Street firms.

“Do I set a bunch of cash on fire to stick around or do I close shop?” asked Brian O’Shaughnessy, co-chief executive officer. “We chose, right or wrong, to close up shop.”

He is now trying to help his roughly 265 employees find jobs at competing firms.

The average price of bonds backed by private-label mortgages recently fell to about 82 cents on the dollar, their lowest level since at least 2011, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Bond prices typically fall when interest rates rise and investors demand higher yields to lend money.

Sales of the bonds made from private-label mortgages, which don’t benefit from federal guarantees, boomed last year when Treasury bonds were paying peanuts.

Normally, loans from alternative lenders are bundled into securities that Wall Street firms sell to pension funds, insurers and other investors. These bonds are known as asset-backed securities, or ABS, and they are typically sold to investors in multiple slices that have different yields based on their risk.

The securitization process is integral to keeping many consumer-finance companies in business, but it can amplify market gyrations in unexpected ways. Prices of collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs—a type of ABS—gapped below fair value in October when U.K. insurers and pensions responded to rising interest rates by dumping CLO bonds.

Some investors have stopped buying ABS, which they still associate with the 2008 financial crisis, to reduce risk. Others are selling out of fear that the loans backing the bonds might go bad. Home prices are already falling in many U.S. cities, and delinquencies are creeping up on auto and other consumer loans.

The biggest change, though, is that insurance companies and pension funds have scaled back their interest in ABS, said Rich Barnett, a partner at investing firm Castlelake LP. Rising interest rates have lifted the yields on corporate bonds and Treasury bonds, making them attractive for the first time in years.

Prudential Financial Inc. has slowed once-brisk purchases of ABS and CLOs in its approximately $400 billion insurance account. Instead, it is snapping up high-rated corporate bonds because their yields have risen, socking them away in preparation for when the Fed starts cutting rates again, chief investment officer Timothy Schmidt said.

Investment-grade corporate bond yields doubled this year to a 13-year high of about 5%, which is close to the roughly 7% return many pensions and insurers shoot for. Another benefit: Corporate bonds have longer terms than most ABS, making them better matches to offset the payout schedules of insurance and pension liabilities.

“We will look back at the assets we’re buying now as pretty attractive,” Mr. Schmidt said. “I don’t think anyone expected rates to move this far this quickly.”

Investors still willing to buy the bonds are making borrowers pay up. Affirm, a buy-now-pay-later company, abandoned plans to issue a $350 million bond in November when investors demanded higher yields than it was willing to pay, people familiar with the matter said. The company also finances loans through bank credit lines and direct sales to investors such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

***Pagaya, a technology-driven consumer finance company, went ahead with a $543 million bond last month but had to pay investors an 8.1% interest rate on its best-quality bonds to get the deal done, according to data from Finsight. That marks a steep increase from the 6.1% rate it got on comparable bonds sold in August and 2% on a deal in January.***

Issuance of consumer-loan ABS declined slightly this year, but Pagaya has nearly doubled bond sales to about $3 billion, according to Finsight. Fees from bond sales account for much of the company’s revenue, according to its financial filings.

At the same time, delinquencies have risen on loans bundled into ABS that Pagaya sold. A bond the company issued in January at 100 cents on the dollar traded in mid-November at around 88 cents, according to data from Empirasign.

Pagaya has been buying loans with tighter underwriting standards this year, and its November bond issuance shows that bond investors trust the company’s artificial-intelligence methodology, its 34-year-old co-founder Gal Krubiner said. The U.S. and Israeli firm uses AI to identify attractive loans that other lenders would turn down, Mr. Krubiner said.

“We saw the uncertainty and volatility coming,” he added.

Pagaya’s stock is trading below $1, down from about $10 three months ago.

***Carvana, an online auto dealer, is facing a cash crunch. Its shares, which soared in the pandemic, have lost 98% of their value this year.*** The company recently hired restructuring advisers.

Asset-backed bonds of companies that go bankrupt typically avoid default, but their prices can fluctuate wildly. A bond backed by auto loans that Carvana issued for 100 cents on the dollar in September 2021 traded around 75 this month, according to data from Empirasign. Part of that decline also reflects the rise in overall interest rates.

For the shrinking pool of investors in the market, the yields have rarely been higher.

Subprime auto lender Flagship Credit Acceptance LLC did a roughly $400 million bond deal in late October. The riskiest chunk of its bonds, which had a double-B rating from some agencies, had a spread of 9 percentage points over going rates.

***No comparable subprime auto bond had ever priced with such a wide spread since at least the last financial crisis, according to John Kerschner, U.S. head of securitized products at Janus Henderson Investors. Investors who bought the debt received a yield of over 13%, according to Finsight.***

“It very much feels like you’re getting paid for the risk right now—and then some, quite frankly,” said Mr. Kerschner, who has been investing broadly in ABS.

While for the RSUs, they basically have the same value as a regular stock and I do not need to buy them. The RSUs are just given to me and when they vest, I can keep them or sell them.

Now my confusion is about taxes. For the stock options, when I buy them, what happens if the price of the stock is higher than the price at which I buy them? Do I need to pay any taxes on the difference? Also, what if I buy them and then sell them right away? Will I pay long term or short term taxes on the gains.

From 2000 to 2010 is oft  sighted as the ""lost decade"" and probably everyone in those days were talking about timing the bottom and or ""staying in cash"" cause it "" was the end of the world"" etc.

From 2000 to 2010 the Vanguard Total Market fund VTSMX returned 1+% a year CAGR,  which yeah wasn't much but it's something and it was actually good because you were buying at reduced prices all those years if your time frame was longer than those 10 years of course.

Also people tend to forget that this was the markets return!! There were plenty of blue chip type companies like UNH COST LIN UNP NEE etc that gave From 7% to 20% a year all along!

So don't just invest in the index if you're so worried!

Also another thing. Yes, from 2000 to 2010 VTSMX gave you a little over 1% a year return, but guess what??

If you had steadily added say $500 a month from 2000 to 2010 into VTSMX??

You ended up with a 24% CAGR!!!

$SAVA - Cassava Sciences: A Timeline,12,zi1k13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zi1k13/sava_cassava_sciences_a_timeline/,22,1670701619.0,"For those of you who are unaware of Cassava Sciences and what they do, they are a clinical stage Biotech company based out of Austin, TX that is in the process of developing their drug Simufilam. This is their solution to early stages of Alzheimer’s. This drug is currently in the early stages of Phase 3 of the FDA approval process. If approved, this drug will be ground breaking for several reasons:  
  
1) It is a pill, thus non invasive.  
2) It is not based on the conventional amyloid hypothesis.  
3) Would be a cheap alternative to other potential prospects attempting to tackle the problem.  
4) Has not shown any negative side effects during the current trials. 
  
The current problem though, which those of you who are familiar with $SAVA is the amount of FUD that has been created as a result from bad acting short sellers looking to profit from blatant misinformation.  
  
Let’s look at a timeline.  
  
- 2nd Quarter of 2021 $SAVA started to gain traction as promising results started to come through it’s phase 2 trials.  
- $SAVA hit an ATH of $123.38 in July of 2021.  
- Since then, it has been a victim of scrutiny and multiple short and distort campaigns involving news outlets and individuals on social media.  
- These bad actors (self admitted short sellers) filed a citizen’s petition to half phase 2 trials for Simufilam to the FDA.  
- In December of 2021, a scientific journal found no evidence of supposed “data manipulation” that had been alleged.  
- In February of this year, that request was denied.  
- In August of this year, another publication cleared $SAVA of supposed “data manipulation”.  
- In November, $SAVA files a lawsuit against the “short and distort” short sellers who have bombarded this company a series of allegations that are not based in science and only based on financial gain.  
  
- No insiders have sold any of their positions in this company. In fact, there have been several insider buys this year. Most notable Sanford Robertson buying 100,000 shares of common stock back in August.  
- The company has issued 50 million dollars in direct offering of common stock.  
- $SAVA has completed its open label study with results coming in the coming days/weeks.  
  
Since the day of the announced common stock purchase (11/22)  the stock has risen over 20%. Exciting times ahead.

*****
> Stocks finished lower Friday, with all the major averages posting losses for the week as worries persisted over continued rate hikes.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 305.02 points, or 0.9%, to close at 33,476.46. The S&P 500 tumbled 0.73% to end at 3,934.38, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7% to finish at 11,004.62.
*****
> On a weekly basis, the Dow fell 2.77% to post its worst week since September. The S&P tumbled 3.37%, while the Nasdaq dropped 3.99%.
*****
> Friday’s moves came after November’s producer price index showed higher-than-expected wholesale prices, which rose 0.3% last month and 7.4% over the previous year. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, also topped expectations.
*****
> Optimistic consumer sentiment data alleviated some fears, but attention remains laser-focused on next week’s busy economic calendar.
*****
> Attention shifted toward the consumer price index due out Tuesday, which is expected to show whether inflation has receded. The Federal Reserve will likely deliver a 50 basis point hike at the end of its December meeting on Wednesday. While the increase would be smaller than the previous four hikes, concerns have mounted over whether the central bank can architect a soft landing and prevent a recession.
*****
> Investors have long hoped for a pivot from the Fed’s aggressive tightening stance, but the data fails to support that desire, said Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg.
*****
> “It’s our expectation that we really need to see inflation come down closer to the fed funds rate for the Fed to pause, and we still have quite a bit of delta between those numbers,” she said. “There’s still a bit of work to be done on the inflation front to really see that as the reality.”
*****
> In other news, shares of Lululemon tumbled nearly 13% after the company gave a weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter outlook. DocuSign jumped on strong results.

> # Quarterly Options Expiration Historically Bullish

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/30804cd4212fb2f406ef46e31ae8248c/63e5a913c7477243-9f/s500x750/a5723d5045a0683344447e2721fb5996ef625828.jpg))**

> In fact, the week of options expiration and the week after have the most bullish record of all quarterly option expirations (page 108, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2022 & 2023 Almanac). Since 1982, DJIA has advanced 30 times during December’s options expiration week with an average gain of 0.51%. S&P 500 has a similar, although slightly softer record.

> However, the record is not pristine. Last year, accelerating inflation metrics triggered concerns the Fed was behind the curve with monetary policy. In 2018, DJIA and S&P 500 suffered their worst weekly loss as the Fed remained hawkish and determined to raise interest rates even as economic growth was slowing and Treasury bond yields were falling. In 2011, Europe’s debt crisis derailed the market. In 2012, the threat of going over the fiscal cliff triggered a nearly 2% loss the week after.

> Going into next week, the market’s bullish historical trends will be tested by the Fed and CPI. The Fed is widely anticipated to raise its rate by 0.5% to a new range of 4.25%-4.50%. Today’s slightly hotter than expected PPI raises the stakes slightly, but the trend of lower inflation does remain intact which suggests the Fed is likely to remain on the course.

> # More Positive Signs for Inflation

> There are many reasons stocks and bonds have had a rough year so far in 2022, and right at the top is the huge spike in inflation this year. With the latest ‘most important economic event of our lifetime’, aka the latest CPI data coming out on Tuesday, today we’ll look at some continued better inflation trends we are seeing.

> First up, the consumer price index was up more than 9% year-over-year in June but has since come back to 7.7%, and we expect the trend to continue lower.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-141-800x546.png))**

> Prices paid for manufacturing have simply crashed lower. If people aren’t paying as much for stuff, there is a good chance they will be able to charge less. As the chart below shows, services prices have been more stubborn, but manufacturing is dropping at a record pace. It recently came in at 43, cut in half from March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-2100-800x546.png))**

> Shelter makes up about 40% of the core inflation basket, so this is a very big deal when it runs hot as it has for most of this year, but should it turn lower, it could be a nice tailwind. Although the government’s data showed that rental prices were recently up more than 7% over the past year, we are seeing private measures of rents slowing down considerably, with the Apartment List nation rent report down a record 1% last month, on the heels of the previous record of 0.8% set the month before.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-334.png))**

> Apartment List found that rents were up 17.6% last year but are up only 4.7% this year, and the trend remains firmly lower.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-4.png))**

> Lastly, rents in 93 cities out of the 100 largest saw rents decline last month, so safe to say this is a widespread trend.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-5.png))**

> Once again, government data lags behind private data, and the truth is that the government looks at existing and new leases, while private indices consider just new ones. Also, for the official data, rental units are sampled only every six months (given that rents aren’t re-negotiated very often). For this reason, we expect CPI rental measurements to lag private indices by about 8-12 months.

> Additionally, Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index has dropped more than 1% back-to-back months for the first time in over a decade and has been lower three months in a row. Again, positive signs show that inflation is coming back to earth.

> Lastly, used car prices continue to sink. According to their data, the Manheim Used Car Index showed that used car prices have dropped a record six months in a row and are down year-over-year 14.2%, the largest decline ever. Given that used cars make up about 5% of headline inflation, this is another potential tailwind as we head into 2023. And similar to rent prices, the government’s data tends to be slow to get with the picture, so we expect these lower used car prices to begin to get into the government’s data more over the coming months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-6-800x377.png))**

> Why does all of this matter? As quickly as inflation soared, we think it could come back down in 2023, and things like rents, prices paid, and used cars are all suggesting that much lower prices could be coming soon. This, of course, would give the Fed room to take the foot off the pedal and likely end rate hikes early next year.

> # Sentiment Staves Off Lower Readings

> Sentiment tipped over before the S&P 500's rough start to December. Without the market giving investors any more reason to take a bullish stance, the latest sentiment data from the AAII showed that once again less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. This week's reading was actually slightly higher rising 0.2 percentage points to 24.7%, a reading in the middle of this year's range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120822-Sentiment-1.png))**

> Although bullish sentiment was higher, bearish sentiment rose by more with the reading going from 40.4% to 41.8%. That is the highest level since November 10th. While bearish sentiment has remained in a relatively tight range just above 40% for the past four weeks, current readings are more muted than what had been observed throughout most of the past year when there have been plenty of readings above 50%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120822-Sentiment-2.png))**

> Overall, sentiment continues to heavily favor bears with a 17.1 percentage point spread between bulls and bears. That extends the record streak of negative readings to 36 weeks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120822-Sentiment-3.png))**

> While the AAII survey was overall little changed, other sentiment readings were a bit mixed. The NAAIM Exposure index dropped to the lowest reading in a month. Conversely, the Investors Intelligence survey saw bulls surge to the highest level since late August combined with the lowest reading in the percentage of respondents expecting a correction since June. Aggregating all of these readings points to sentiment taking a bit more pessimistic of a stance this week than what has been observed over the past month.

> # S&P 500 (SPY) December Drop

> The S&P 500 (SPY) has struggled to pick a direction so far this morning but at least as of this writing, it is on pace to finish lower yet again. From a technical perspective, the index is at a cross roads having formed a wedge in the past couple of months. During the recent rally, SPY did manage to move back above its 200-DMA, but it couldn't quite get above the past year's downtrend line. After the streak of declines in the past week, it has returned to the bottom of the rough uptrend line that has been in place off the October lows.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120722-SPY-1.png))**

> Again price action has been choppy so far today, and while further declines could result in a break down, it would also mark an impressive, but not exactly unheard of, streak of declines. As shown below, it would be the fifth daily decline in a row. From a historical perspective, that is not particularly rare with 65 other streaks of 5 days or more since SPY began trading. As recently as October and September, there were two streaks that even extended to 6 days long.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120722-SPY-2.png))**

> What is more rare is for these streaks to start at the beginning of a new month. In fact, this month's 3.5% drop to start December is on pace to be the 20th worst start of a month for the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) since inception, and there have only been two other times in which all of the first five trading days of a month have seen declines: February 2002 and June 2011. As shown below, those streaks of declines actually came in what were the middle of periods of consolidation while the following few months went on to experience further downside. As for the actual size of the declines, both of those previous instances saw larger drops (roughly around 4.5%) than the 3.5% decline currently.

> # Bonds Catch a Bid as Stocks Sink

> US equity markets have gotten off to a very weak start to December with four consecutive declines to start the month (and futures on Wednesday pointing to a fifth straight day). As shown below, SPY and most other major US index ETFs are already down more than 3% MTD, with growth underperforming value by a bit. Energy (XLE) is down most of the US sector ETFs followed by Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Financials (XLF). Utilities (XLU) is down the least so far in December at just -0.50%.

> International equity markets have held up a little better than the US. The All-World ex-US ETF (CWI) and the Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) are both down just 1.2% MTD, and the All-World ex-US ETF is now outperforming SPY on a YTD basis because of the recent divergence.

> For most of the year heading into December, we saw the bond market fall in tandem with stocks, but recently as stocks have dropped, bonds have caught a bid. As shown in the bottom right corner of our ETF matrix below, Treasury ETFs of all durations are up on the month, with the 20+ Year Treasury (TLT) up the most at 4.35%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120722etf.png))**

> The chart below of the year-to-date percentage change (total return) of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) is a great way to highlight how closely stocks and bonds have tracked each other this year. So far this month, QQQ is down 3.98%, while TLT is up 4.35%, but this performance divergence over the last four days hardly shows up yet on the chart.

> # Back-to-Back Monthly Surge Consolidating Gains

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/blog_20221207_SP_5per_streak_table.jpg))**

> Chances are you have already heard about the S&P 500 gaining more than 5% in October and November this year. We can confirm this feat is not all that common occurring only 11 times since 1950 including this year. The longest S&P 500 streak of monthly gains in excess of 5% per month was in 1998 beginning in September with a 6.2% advance, followed by 8.0% in October, 5.9% in November and 5.6% in December for a total gain of 28.4% in four months. The most recent streak was respectable, up 13.79% in two months.

> Based upon the Bull & Bear Markets table on page 134 of the 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac, all ten previous streaks occurred in bull markets. Streaks in 2020, 2009, 2002, 1998 and 1974 all occurred early in new bull markets. Performance after the previous 10 monthly streaks ended was broadly bullish, but choppy during the 1-month immediately following. The recent tough start of trading this month is consistent with the consolidation that followed past streaks and the more recent 21-year Seasonal Pattern for December.

> Digging deeper into the data we have graphed the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the previous 10 streaks in the following chart. A typical calendar month has 21 trading days on average. We elected to set our reference point at the day the monthly streak ended. The sizable gain in the 30 trading days before is clear. What also becomes more visible is the tendency for the S&P 500 to pause and consolidate those gains in the 15-20 trading days after the streak’s end. Following this period, the S&P 500 historically resumed its march higher and was always higher 1-year after the streak ended.ail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

> # When does the Santa Claus Rally Start?

> As we noted on the blog last week, December is historically a strong month for stocks, and we don’t expect 2022 to be any different. It is historically the third-best month for the S&P 500 since 1950 (April and November are stronger) and third-best during a midterm year (with October and November better).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-1-copy-800x338.png))**

> Here are some of the major takeaways from that blog:

> * When stocks are down for the year heading into this month, December has been higher eight of the past nine times.

> * Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years, the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013.
Midterm years have been worse lately, down a record 9.1% last time (in 2018) but also down in 2014. At least we’ve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years.

> * When stocks are up in both October and November (which could be the case this year as long as we don’t see a massive drop today), the S&P 500 doesn’t do quite as well in December, up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54%, suggesting the prior months could be taking some of December’s historical strength.

> * Lastly, only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the S&P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time, and it caused massive selling, but this month is usually quite calm, and big drops are rare.

> Taking things a step further, though, when does Santa come to town? One of the most well-known investment axioms is the “Santa Claus Rally,” and most investors assume it just means that stocks do well all of December, but this isn’t the case. It turns out that most of the strength in December happens in the latter half of the month. It makes sense to me, given that this is when Santa comes.

Should a person be investing in oil now that it is at a 1 year low? My personal opinion: Yes,0,zh6ll1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zh6ll1/should_a_person_be_investing_in_oil_now_that_it/,67,1670614892.0,"I typically am the person people close to me go to for stock advice. Stocks are fairly easy to predict the next 12 month trajectory - oil on the other hand is a commodity and therefore is not able to like a stock be looked at using a P/E ratio (one of the best to determine how to trade a stock). Is now the time for people to pile into investing in oil? Or should we not touch oil due to the high probability of a recession in 2023? 

Reasons to not trade oil over the next 1 year: 

\- Winter was supposedly going to be horrible in many European countries (we all have seen that 2 minute video from Russia trying to show Europe freezing over in the winter) and oil was supposed to soar ... That is not the case anymore ([https://www.upi.com/Top\_News/World-News/2022/10/26/eu-natgas-storage-rystad-ttf/1691666803260/](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2022/10/26/eu-natgas-storage-rystad-ttf/1691666803260/)) as oil reserves have been filled and everything should be fine. 

\- Speaking more long term oil really is just not going to be around decades from now, and even if this is wrong much more money can be made in other investments 

Reasons to trade oil over the next 1 year: 

\- If there seems to be something wrong with the price of oil it is slapping me in the face right now and that is the following: WTI Jan. 23 as of 1:30pm = $70.33... Look at any 10 year ([https://www.macrotrends.net/2516/wti-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2516/wti-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart)) or 5 year chart and you will quickly see oil's average over 10 years or 5 years is above what it is currently trading at. 

Bottom line: I will be buying up oil stocks and will dip my toes into ETFs including USO and OILU (OILU is a leveraged oil futures ETF) if and only if oil dips below $65 in the coming 2 weeks. I believe we will have a global recession and will try to swing trade oil stocks/ETFs before a potential massive dip takes place. I do see even with oil reserves in Europe being full right now a steady rise in oil prices in the west over the next 3 months, hopefully timed before any sort of broader market slide.",2022-12-09 21:41:32
RITM vs GLPI,7,zh5w4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zh5w4u/ritm_vs_glpi/,3,1670613202.0,"I've got kind of a shotgun approach currently, and I invest in both of these, GLPI has been increasing, and RITM (formerly NRZ) decreasing in stock price, they've both maintained a similar dividend since an initial crash in 2020, but the decreasing price of RITM has put it up to 11% on price.

Are people fleeing this from fears they won't be able to serve as their own property manager efficiently, or fear that the dividend might drop again like they did in 2020, or is there something negative in financials? I'm holding long and averaging on everything to keep my cost low in this environment, but I'm wondering if I should adjust my ratio between these two to favor GLPI since it's growing, but the yield is lower (still good tho), while the combined yield is better, my time horizon is 5 to 10 so I expect at some point things to stabilize maybe in 9 months or so, but obviously the short term on residential REITs isn't rosy, so that's another nail in RITM",2022-12-09 21:13:22

The most recent update to forward EPS projections is now at 225 EPS for 2023 ([https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf)).

That means that at S&P 4000, we'd be trading at a 18 forward P/E. The historical average over the last 10 years is a 17x forward P/E, but this was with effectively 0% interest rates.

Growth is continuing to slow, and there's a real chance we'll see further earnings revisions to the downside.

In other words, the market is over valued because ""Santa rally"", or because the market would rather focus on inflation coming down instead of actual earnings growth and valuation multiples. I called out in a previous post that the market would rally into year end, and possibly into January, but it's likely a Bull trap as all we've really done over the last 2 months is multiple expansion, not real earnings growth.

What do you think is a fair multiple at 4%+ interest rates? I would argue 16x forward makes sense, so on 225 EPS that would make the fair value of the S&P 3600 today. Obviously this isn't a perfect method of valuation and there are many other factors to consider, this is just a framework for how I think about a potential trading range we could see into next year.",2022-12-09 19:38:41

"Wholesale prices rose 0.3% in November, more than expected, despite hopes that inflation is cooling",1214,zgxnpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zgxnpj/wholesale_prices_rose_03_in_november_more_than/,294,1670593284.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/09/wholesale-prices-rose-0point3percent-in-november-more-than-expected-despite-hopes-that-inflation-is-cooling.html

Wholesale prices rose more than expected in November, dampening hopes that inflation could be headed lower, the Labor Department reported Friday.

The producer price index, a measure of what companies get for their products in the pipeline, increased 0.3% for the month and 7.4% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a 0.2% gain.

Excluding food and energy, core PPI was up 0.4%, also against a 0.2% estimate.

The release comes amid other signs that price increases at least were decelerating from a pace that had put inflation at its highest level in more than 40 years. However, the data Friday, which tends to be a leading indicator of underlying price pressures, shows that shaking off inflation could be a long slog.

This was the third month in a row that headline PPI increased 0.3%. On an annual basis, the increase represents a decline from the 11.7% peak hit in March, but is still well ahead of the pre-pandemic pace at least going back to 2010.",2022-12-09 15:41:24

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I was planning to double major in this and add on business to put me in a higher position of my field, but am considering transferring to a 4 year university to study finance/economics or just business administration instead. 

I have a passion for business and economics related stuff and have found it fascinating. I spend a lot of my free time reading and learning about the economics and business related stuff. I got into investing at a young age and find analyzing the market and numbers interesting even though I’m not the best at math. In my economics classes during Highschool I placed in the top 20 out of a few thousand in my state for the “stock market simulation” we did. I constantly talk more about financial and business related stuff more than what I’m studying and people at my college even tell me id probably be better off in that field. I’ve been told business administration is too general and finance is very competitive. I’m a lot different personality wise and value wise at my school and feel like a black sheep since I’ve been here. I’ve also taken may personality tests and continue to get “intj-a” which is one of the rarest personality types.


If I decide to follow through of transferring I’m not sure how that would work and don’t think my credits will transfer. My school offers business administration at all levels, accounting, and marketing, but not finance which is what I was interested in. I am unsure what to tell my parents and what the next steps would be. What are your thoughts on the field or my situation?",2022-12-09 02:51:26

A question about my shares,1,zga4mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zga4mw/a_question_about_my_shares/,10,1670530473.0,"Hello,
I’ve put some money into stocks but I’m no wizard when it comes to them so this question might be something basic that I just don’t understand.

In 2019 I purchased some shares in a pharma company that was pretty new, but I had high hopes for it and it wasn’t very expensive so I bought some. I bought more of the same stock every now and then for a year or two. Eventually I had 200 shares. I stopped keeping up with the stocks I was invested in and just let them sit.

Today I decided to look at my portfolio just because I haven’t in a while. When I saw my shares it said I only had 6 shares instead of 200. I also looked at the market history of this stock. It says in 2019 it was worth 135 dollars or something when I know I only bought it back then for around 4 dollars. 

Did the stock change in some way? I know at one point the price got really low, like below a dollar if I remember correctly. Would that have effected it in anyway?

Again, I apologize if this is a basic thing about the stock market I just don’t understand.",2022-12-08 22:14:33
FTC sues to block Microsoft’s acquisition of game giant Activision,321,zg8c32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zg8c32/ftc_sues_to_block_microsofts_acquisition_of_game/,126,1670526810.0,"

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-microsoft-over-activision/

>The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday sued to block Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard, charging that the massive deal would allow the Washington tech giant to suppress its competitors in gaming.

>The lawsuit represents the FTC’s most significant effort to rein in consolidation in the tech industry since prominent tech critic Lina Khan (D) became the commission’s chair and was expected to usher in a new era of antitrust enforcement characterized by a willingness to bring cases in court rather than pursue settlements with companies.

...


This represents the most obvious real-life answer to the people asking if the MS/Activision deal was free money (and how it isn't). It looks like Lina Khan might be looking to make a name for herself in pursuing antitrust action by going after more M&A.

The bottom is in. Just keep dcaing into indexes and in 20 years you'll have a lot more money.. Easy,0,zg7c4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zg7c4g/the_bottom_is_in_just_keep_dcaing_into_indexes/,27,1670524762.0,"The bottom is always in when your outlook is 20 years from now my friends!

The best way to make money long term is to keep buying in small amounts each week into and index.

Ignore Cnbc! They're in business to keep people watching. Yes, you can learn some things and get a general market sense, etc,but take everything you hear with a grain of salt!

Remember that the people they have on are usually trying to pump their own stocks or get you to go along with their investing thesis,not to help YOU, but to make money for themselves. That's just my opinion.

Anyways I have about 20 good companies that I average down in but I'm slowly coming around to the idea of indexing a larger portion and just dcaing.

Some indexes I like are VTI QQQ QTEC IGV XLV IBB.

Then I have mostly blue chips like UNH MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA LIN UNP COST ASML LRCX etc.

But I think for the average investor with a 10 to 20 year look out, the ""bottom"" is NOW.

I mean by that that when you look back 5, 10 and 20 years from now most indexes and good companies will be a ""bottom"" compared to where they'll be in those.time frames.

So for the average investor seriously you're best bet to be successful long term is to pick an index or two, not a sector, but a broad index or two like say VTI and QQQ and just do a 50/50 weekly.

For example if you inest $100 A week, just put $50 into VTI  and QQQ each week and get on with life. You're not concerned with what happens next week, next month etc. You just keep buying!

So if you throw $50 into QQQ and it's  ""crashes"" 50% next week .... awesome!!! THATS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY!!

Always keep positive and have a positive outlook on life. Keep yourself fit and as healthy as possible and don't eat a lot of junk. Try to eat as little as you can. That's what I do now. I fast every day for at least 12 hours.

So keep buying into indexes. If you want to mess with individual  stocks I think you should keep it to about 20% of your portfolio  and maybe under 20 positions.

I also like to keep at least 30% cash right now, but maybe I should have more of that cash in low risk stocks like JNJ etc.

Anyways good luck all and remember that if you're under 40 you should just keep buying on autopilot into VTI or whatever. Don't woŕy about seeing RED in your portfolio.  You aren't concerned with what happens short term and RED means you now can buy either your index or favorite stocks for cheaper!!",2022-12-08 20:39:22
Is a wash sale an issue if you do not report it?,24,zg7a91,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zg7a91/is_a_wash_sale_an_issue_if_you_do_not_report_it/,30,1670524649.0,"Hi there,

A bit new to some of the investing laws in the US and I have a question about wash sales rules?

If I sell one stock in one platform and buy the same stock in another I know that triggers a wash sale from a legal perspective but that is only illegal or a penalty if you try to report those loses is that correct?

I am in an unique situation where I need to have a certain amount if funds in one platform but transfering the stocks will take too long so I am wondering if I could sell, transfer the money and buy again without incurring in anything illegal as long as I do not claim those losses.  


And last question, does the wash sale rule apply to the sale as a whole or to individual lots? Let me explain it:  


I have a 200 shares of a stock that I bought 100 shares at 1 USD and 100 shares at 2 dollars. Total cost is 300 USD now the stock is at 1.62 so worth 324, if I sell my position and buy again would this trigger a wash sale even though as a whole I am reporting a 24 USD profit? 

  
I hope I am making sense.

Thanks",2022-12-08 20:37:29
Patience and temperament beat more math and prediction,10,zg6qu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zg6qu1/patience_and_temperament_beat_more_math_and/,6,1670523551.0,"Examples of actual bargain hunting might be useful for people seeing a new barrage of garbage headlines predicting recession, depression, the bottom being in, the fed raising rates, the fed pivoting, deflation worries turning into inflation worries, gas prices being too high causing a recession, oil prices being too low causing a recession, or Jay Powell doing a 540 kick flip while Tony Hawk is cheering from the sidelines.

So here's one that just happened recently, with new developments this morning...

# Part 1: The setup

Saga Communications (SGA), a radio broadcaster headquartered out of Gross Pointe (Detroit suburbs), just today declared a 2nd special dividend and a new variable dividend policy moving forward. But how did we get here?

***The founder died.***

SGA was a controlled company, with a dual-class share structure. Edward Christian, who had been there since the start (1986) and of course the 1992 IPO, owned the Class B shares with 10x voting power and otherwise identical rights. So, despite not owning anywhere near 51%, he controlled the company.

In the covenants was stated that upon the passing of an owner of Class B shares, the shares would automatically revert to Class A shares (1:1) as they pass on to the inheritence of Ed's choosing, with all the dividend and voting rights concurrent with an A share.

***In other words, when Ed passed the controlled company is no longer controlled.*** Now I (and I doubt anyone else) had any idea this was going to happen. I only knew it was not an unreasonable possibility, *as he was 78 yrs old*, and understood what would happen in that event by reading. The [DEF14A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886136/000110465922045692/tm223643-1_def14a.htm#tSOOC) gives a quick overview of executive compensation, change of control events, and the like.

As you can see, Edward was being compensated - ***enormously***. He pulled in an average stated compensation of $2.5 million the past 3 years, while the company's net earnings over those years averaged $7.5 million. His two hand picked lieutenants averaged about $800k (combined!) per year in that time frame. **Fully 1/3 of the company's net profit was going directly into the pockets of the top 3 officers**, the majority going to the controlling owner. Whether you believe the acumen and operational skills of these three gentleman warranted such enormous compensation is up to you, but this is not surprising or uncommon.

He controls the company, picks the board, and thus names his own pay. Only shame or fear of litigation might cause a person to reign in the excess.

None of this is new. Ben Graham talked about it nearly 100 years ago. Jay Galbraith expounded on it in The New Industrial State.

So what happened?

# Part II: The payoff

None of this was ordained. For all I (or anyone else knew) this guy could have lived another 20 years, and continued collecting 1/4 of the SGA's net earnings in compensation every year.

Almost immediately after the announcement, within a day I believe, FMR (Fidelity Magellan Research) - Peter Lynch's old firm - took a significant stake. I bought my shares for between $19 and $22, about 1.5 years ago. At the time, it was a reasonable bargain with a few potential upsides, a solid history of positive earnings, a great balance sheet, a decent franchise, and a variable history of dividends. Compared to their normal earnings ($2.25/sh or so), and considering the financial strength, this company traded at a bargain (low multiple).

Of the upsides, this change of control was one. The election spending on advertising was another. A return to normal from Covid (and reversion to the mean in earnings) was another.

Shortly after FMR took their position, the board held a meeting and declared a special dividend, $2. This morning they declared another $2 dividend, along with a ""variable dividend policy"". I'm not sure how that changes much, as they've paid variable dividends for years. I think it's double speak that actually means: *We recognize this company is now at the behest of large stakeholders and we're going to have to return more money to owners to save our board seats.*

Everybody is self interested (selfish). This rule has zero exceptions. Learn this, life and investing will make much more sense.

# Part III: Conclusions

This one could have gone several ways.

1. The stock could have stagnated for a long time, with nothing happening to prompt any revaluation, cash remaining tied up in the business, and executives continuing to siphon large portions for themselves and in support of the board, which was entirely at the behest of the CEO & Chairman.
2. Some bad news could have come along, in which case the stock price may have dipped somewhat temporarily. It would be hard to imagine it falling too much for too long, as they did (even in the controlled company time) pay not insignificant dividends and were earning plenty to easily support what I thought was a rock bottom valuation, relative to the market.
3. As Walter Schloss used to say, ""*If I buy a dollar for 40 cents, something good might happen to me*."" In this case, it took about 1.5 years to play out. In the meanwhile, I collected a few dividends. Now after these two special dividends ($4 total, the second $2 being paid in January 2023) my cost basis is essentially $15.5/sh for a company that earnings $2-3/yr and pays most of that out in dividends.

It doesn't always work out this way. If you take 20 such situations, a few will sit for years and do nothing. One might go south on you. But in a basket of such opportunities, the majority will turn in your favor, sooner or later.

It requires patience and temperament, but nothing more than basic arithmetic and the willingness to investigate (read!). You don't need an Einstein IQ to do this. Read everyday and be willing to say No to almost everything.

Tune out the daily macro bullshit. Focus on businesses.",2022-12-08 20:19:11

# [Stock futures rise as investors assess risk of an economic downturn](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures moved slightly higher Thursday after the S&P 500 declined for a fifth consecutive day and Wall Street evaluated the likelihood of a recession ahead.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 100 points, or 0.4%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.4%.
*****
> Exxon rose 1% as the oil giant it lifted its buybacks, while Chevron gained on a higher capital spending budget. Tesla slumped amid reports of shortened shifts at its Shanghai factory.
*****
> “U.S. equity futures are trying to stabilize, and Treasuries are witnessing tiny profit taking, but the mood is still gloomy,” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge in a note to clients Thursday. “The problem for domestic stocks is the absence of catalysts – two inflation figures come Fri (PPI and Michigan expectations), but the real fireworks arrive next week.”
*****
> Investors’ attention has shifted toward next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to issue a 50 basis point interest rate hike. It’s a smaller increase than the prior four rate hikes, but may do little to alleviate concerns over whether the Fed can avoid a recession next year in its attempt to squash surging prices. November’s consumer price index, due Tuesday, should also provide more clarity on the direction of inflation.
*****
> In the near term, Wall Street awaits the latest data on weekly jobless claims before the bell on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are anticipating claims to come in at 230,000, up slightly from the prior week’s total of 225,000.
*****
> Traders expect most recent earnings results from Lululemon Athletica, DocuSign, Broadcom and Costco after the bell Thursday.
*****
> On Wednesday, the S&P 500 declined 0.19% in its fifth straight losing session. The Dow was virtually flat, adding just 1.58 points. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.51%.

Now, the [article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-see-shift-in-europes-fortunes-11670409163?mod=markets_lead_pos5).

> Investors are turning somewhat more positive on Europe, spurring a recovery in the region’s beaten-down stocks.
> 
> As of Tuesday’s close, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 index had **gained nearly 19% this quarter**, putting it on track for the **best quarterly performance since 2009**. The rise for the index, which includes eurozone blue chips like L’Oréal SA and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, compares with a **9.9% gain for the S&P 500**. [Graph from article](https://i.imgur.com/13ilMHL.png).
> 
> The mood has brightened after a period of extreme pessimism about Europe, brought on by the invasion of Ukraine, a subsequent jump in energy prices and the highest inflation in decades. Russia was the biggest energy supplier to the European Union, rendering the region vulnerable to shocks from Western sanctions.
> 
> Market sentiment is being lifted by early signs of inflation easing in the eurozone and hopes that the scramble for alternatives to Russian natural gas has reduced the risk of an energy crisis this winter, investors and analysts said. Meanwhile, benchmark U.S. yields and the dollar have declined in recent weeks, helping lift riskier assets worldwide, as investors anticipate a slowdown in the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates.
> 
> “We’re in a recovery trade. There’s still going to be a recession. But what we’re seeing is signs that the recession won’t be as bad and that inflation might calm down more quickly than people thought,” said Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura.
> 
> Foreign investors have snapped up European assets. In a marker of that international appetite, **flows into exchange-traded funds** holding eurozone-based stocks, but which are denominated in other currencies, rose to the **highest monthly level since early 2021** last month, Nomura analysis showed. [Graph from article](https://i.imgur.com/jissVrh.png).
> 
> The annual eurozone **inflation rate declined in November** for the first time since mid-2021, falling to **10%, from 10.6% in October**. A pullback in oil and other energy prices helped. Natural-gas prices have stabilized as Europe’s gas storage has risen above 95% due to imports of liquefied-natural gas, reducing the risk of an energy crunch.
> 
> Investors now expect the European Central Bank’s **key policy rate to reach 2.8% next summer**, market prices suggest, down from forecasts of more than 3% a month ago.
> 
> As in the U.S., where consumer-price inflation has also eased, investors are hoping that central bankers won’t have to tighten financial conditions so aggressively that they trigger a deep recession. In turn, expectations of a milder downturn and cheaper capital available to companies are boosting European stock and bond markets.
> 
> “The Fed and the ECB are winning the war against inflation, and at some point, we’re going to see a pause from the central banks. This is something that will drive the market higher,” said Roland Kaloyan, head of European equity strategy at Société Générale.
> 
> Some of the best-performing stocks in Europe this quarter are in the industrial sector. These companies were among the hardest-hit by the disruptions to gas supplies and jump in energy prices, with many companies temporarily shutting factories or reducing production.
> 
> Shares in France’s Alstom SA are up 43% this quarter, while those in Siemens Energy AG of Germany have risen 42%.
> 
> Some analysts expect other energy-intensive sectors to benefit from cheaper energy and the recent loosening of Covid-19 restrictions in China, one of the EU’s biggest trading partners.
> 
> “One of the sectors in which I see a lot of upside potential in Europe is the automobile sector,” Mr. Kaloyan said. He expects supply-chain conditions to keep improving. Europe’s major car makers include Volkswagen AG and Stellantis NV.
> 
> Conditions in the credit markets have also improved, with a decline in spreads, or the extra yields compared with a benchmark that investors demand to hold riskier bonds.
> 
> The **spread on an ICE BofA index of bonds in euros** issued by industrial companies **narrowed to 1.6 percentage points** above a benchmark. That is down from 2.1 points at the end of September, but still above the average 1.1 percentage point over the past 10 years.
> 
> Some remain cautious about the region’s prospects, for example if the Russia-Ukraine war drives more volatility in energy prices and inflation.
> 
> “The rally that we have seen was followed by the optimistic view that the energy crunch might not be as bad as we feared,” said Antonio Cavarero, head of investments at Generali Insurance Asset Management. “But Europe is still very much exposed.”",2022-12-08 01:18:28

# [Stock futures fall Wednesday as recession fears continue to batter market sentiment](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures slid Wednesday, with traders fretting over the possibility of a recession as the Federal Reserve could raise rates for longer than expected.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 142 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 futures lost 0.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures traded lower by 1.1%.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off another tough session, with the Dow falling more than 350 points, or 1.03%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 1.4% and 2%, respectively.
*****
> Investors have been losing hope that the Fed will be able to engineer a so-called soft landing that successfully tamps down inflation through higher rates and also avoids a recession. Instead, concerns are swirling around the state of the economy and the likelihood of a downturn in 2023.
*****
> “All told, financial indicators point to a recession on the horizon,” wrote Wells Fargo’s Azhar Iqbal in a note to clients Wednesday. “The S&P 500 has peaked ahead of recessions with an average lead time of four months over the past few business cycles. Taken together with the inverted yield curve, markets are clearly braced for a recession in 2023.”
*****
> Investors await more economic data this week for clues on what to expect from the Fed. Mortgage loan application data showed a decline last week despite a fall in rates.
*****
> The tail end of earnings season continued with a solid report from Campbell Soup.

Financial Statements Explained:,4,zemcbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zemcbp/financial_statements_explained/,11,1670370864.0,"Financial statements provide a snapshot of a company's financial health, allowing investors to make informed decisions about their investments. The three main types are the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.  


**Balance Sheet:**

The balance sheet is a financial statement that shows a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time.  


The balance sheet provides a comprehensive view of a company's financial position, allowing stakeholders to assess its overall health.  


**Income Statement:**

The income statement is a financial statement that shows a company's revenues, expenses, and net income over a specific period of time.  


The income statement provides a detailed look at the company's performance, allowing stakeholders to assess its profitability and sustainability.  


**Cash flow statement:**

The cash flow statement is a financial statement that shows a company's inflows and outflows of cash over a specific period of time.  


The cash flow statement provides a detailed look at the company's cash management, allowing stakeholders to assess its liquidity and financial stability.  


**Bottom line:**

It is important to review financial statements to make informed decisions. These documents provide valuable information about a company's financial position, performance, and stability, and can help stakeholders identify potential issues and opportunities for improvement. 

&#x200B;

In addition to these three financial statements, there are several other types of financial statements that are relevant. For example, the statement of cash flows provides a more in-depth look at a company's cash management, while the statement of stockholders' equity shows the changes in a company's equity over time.",2022-12-07 01:54:24

On bargains and how they find you,24,zefx5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zefx5j/on_bargains_and_how_they_find_you/,6,1670355738.0,"**TL;DR** This story all words and no pictures. If reading bothers you, well you've been warned.

Instead of trying to guess which way today's S&P arrow is headed, **why not learn about some business you might buy two or three years from now**?

That's what today's story is about. **A business I learned a little about 3 years ago, in** ***2019***. A few days ago the price cratered on news (Dec 1st), and I bought a small pile of shares along with a 2-week option. That company is called **G-III**. It's a ""growth"" stock, in the sense that it doesn't pay a dividend. Otherwise, it's growth story is underwhelming.

If I hadn't done the reading three years ago, this flash crash would have been just another blip on the radar. I wouldn't have given it a second glance.

These situations can represent bargains at the right price, and on December 1st, the market shit a giant brick about some consequential but overblown news. Someone, or multiple someones, panicked. ***G-III saw it's price cut almost in half, in a single trading day.***

G-III is helmed by a guy named Goldfarb, whose son is in line to take over the operation. He's been at the helm forever, 2nd only to Warren Buffett in tenure length for publicly traded companies. It's a high-end fashion retailer, with owned brands such as DKNY, Donna Karan, and Karl Lagerfeld. They sell things like $600 dresses, $300 sweaters, and $800 cashmere coats. They also sell some cheaper stuff, like *tops which only run $150*.

The cheapest clothing on DKNY is $150.

So why did this stock shit the proverbial bed? They announced the licensing arrangements with Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein will phase out over the next 3-4 years. To be certain, this is meaningful news. Those are big names and represent about 1/2 of G-III's revenue.

But here's the catch. They're ***licenses***. The owners of the Hilfiger and Klein brands are making most of the profit on those sales, not G-III. As far as G-III is concerned, these are lower margin prospects than their own in-house brands.

Well, how do you value in-house brands? What are you, some kind of fashionista? Not remotely. That's exactly how I value them. I - the most unfashionable person you've likely ever met - *have heard of these names*. DKNY. Karl Lagerfeld. I'm not Parisian, where Lagerfeld is based. I'm french the way french fries are french. Yet I've heard of it. If I've heard of them - someone who shops thrift stores and considers $5 a bit much for secondhand pants - then they have significant name recognition.

G-III also services licenses for every major sports franchise in the US (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL). This is another line of revenue which doesn't appear it will be impacted.

Now I could have rushed into the financials on December 1st when this knife is falling, but here's how doing your homework ahead of time helps.

***I already knew the story and the financials, when I looked at this business 3 years ago.***

G-III has a decent, balance sheet. Earnings growth is roughly 6.2% over the past decade on a 3 yr bookend measurement (2020-21-22 vs 2011-12-13). That's not exciting for a *growth* company. Revenue growth on the same metric is 8%. Again, big deal.

Operating margins sit around 7-8%. So if we expect half the revenue to drop off, and margins to improve slightly since they're now selling only in-house brands - 3 years from now - what do we expect?

The good news? They haven't had a negative year since 2009.

Napkin math? I expect $1.50-3/sh the next couple years and $1-2/sh going forward after the Hilfiger/Klein phase out. So what am I getting for $11.50 per share? Let's say $2.25 for 3 years and $1.50 for 3 years after that. That's $11.25. I got my money back in 6 years. That's a bear case. It's assuming they don't replace any of these licenses with other profit generating brand licenses. That's assuming both these brands do part ways with G-III. None of this is set in stone.

Beyond that, Goldfarb Sr. has hinted that brands spun-off will generally fetch significantly higher multiples than markets assign them in public companies. True or not, I don't know. But it's another avenue that could yield reward.

I knew enough about G-III to know it wasn't a great deal in the $20 range. I also knew I don't know shit about fashion, so unless it's extremely obvious I have no business getting involved.

Enter the screaming bargain. A 40+ percent drop in a stock price in a day requires a real catastrophe. This isn't a real catastrophe. It's not good news, to be certain. But it's not a catastrophe.

So what happens today? Some good news. [Goldfarb bought $3 million of his own stock](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&CIK=0000821002), on the open market - increasing his personal holdings 13.5%. His son (Goldfarb Jr.) bought better than 4% more for himself. This is a meaningful confirmation.

Selling by insiders has a million reasons. There is only one reason they buy.

The bull case is that the market is going to figure out this news is overblown and some humans will step in to take advantage of the fire sale. That's why I picked up the short dated option.

This is not a large position, because I don't have a ton of knowledge about the business or fashion generally. Position sizing matters. It is, however, in my eyes a screaming bargain.

Anyways, if you get tired of watching the squiggle of the S&P and trying to guess which way it's going, instead try reading up on a business or two each day. In a year, you can accumulate general knowledge of around 700 businesses with 20-30 minutes of effort each day.

This is what Buffett, Schloss, Ruane, Simpson, Lynch and the rest of the great investors were doing when they were young. It takes patience, but it still works just as well as it did 20, 40, 60 years ago.

Do your own research. I could be wrong.",2022-12-06 21:42:18

Trying to look at data going back long enough to not invest in companies who have elevated numbers due to covid but were actually proven well before. Or at least have a promising future of growth. Any ideas?

Realizing Losses to Offset Gains,4,zeexga,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zeexga/realizing_losses_to_offset_gains/,17,1670353346.0,"I have a large amount of stocks that have pretty much gone into the toilet and are expected to be there for a long time. I’d like to sell a bit of them to harvest the capital losses. I have some SPY index funds that have about 10% unrealized gains. I don’t need to liquidate my stocks for any cash. I was wondering if I should sell a bit of SPY to realize the gains, realize the losses in my garbage stock, and repurchase SPY again right after? 

I know there’s some caveats with wash sales but that seems to only apply to losses which wouldn’t be applicable since I’m repurchasing SPY. I will also probably hold onto SPY for another year so no concerns with waiting them out to become long term capital gains again. 

Anything to be aware of?",2022-12-06 21:02:26

Why this is a weird time and the market is erratic and volatile,75,ze8l4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ze8l4d/why_this_is_a_weird_time_and_the_market_is/,39,1670337968.0,"In a nutshell, I've come up with the following assessment based on my research that isn't calling a bottom or anything but is driving my investment strategy.  


Since 2009, the market has been driven more by the Federal Reserve Fund Rate (FFR) that enabled a lot of companies to grow, particularly in the tech industries, due to easy debt availability.  The FFR was negative in real terms (in relationship to true inflation rates) and off-shoring allowed for easy access to cheap labor on staples and manufacturing.  This allowed wages to be suppressed, even in non-staple industries.  An example is why your support phone calls to Dell are taken in Mumbai.  The CSR's are getting paid fractions of what US CSR's would receive for the same work.  


The COVID shut downs of 2020 came with unemployment at 3.5% leading into it.  However, there was stagnant wage growth at that time.  For reference sake, average unemployment from 1948 until 2015 was 5.8%.  The Federal Reserve targets 5% unemployment as its target.  Above that isn't necessarily healthy because it leaves companies short staffed and doesn't allow for wage growth in-line with the Fed's target inflation rate of 2.5%.  Since wages were not increasing at a rate commiserate with inflation in real terms and because social security payouts were so low as well in terms of pre-70 retirements, older folks were working longer.  Then along came COVID.  


COVID-based lockdowns caused massive layoffs, to the tune of a 12-13% spike in unemployment.  The US went from 3.5% to 14.7% unemployment basically in the course of weeks.  The easing of the lockdowns took over a year.  The Federal Reserve and Congress' response was to dump a ton of money in enhanced unemployment benefits, drop nominal rates to zero, and juice the stock market from a massive drop into a blow-off top with the S&P hitting 4800.  Suddenly, a lot of 60+ year old's retirement accounts got a lot more valuable.  There was a lot of incentive to stop working for a lot of people who historically would have been out of the workforce 5-10 years earlier.  This is tied to a demographic issue based on lower birth rates tied to stagnant wage growth, higher debt levels, and higher quality of life and fundamental shifts in how people chose to live life.  


In lockstep, the outsourced staples and manufacturing had inflation problems because the labor issues spread globally as entire continents locked down.  The entire global supply chain got, for lack of a better term, FUBAR'ed.  This jacked shipping, production, and commodity prices, on top of what had been developing upward pressure on those prices due to global climate concerns.  This caused inflation which is still manifesting.  


Historically, inflation can't be tamed until the FFR is positive in real terms (rates above inflation rate).  We aren't there yet, but should get there by Q1 of '23.  History says a ""soft landing"" is not likely because the very thing the Fed has to do to tame inflation is recessionary.  Unemployment has to go up.  And that's the crux of why I am writing this:  
We're in a weird time, because unemployment isn't likely to give much of a care about rates.  Simply put, the available labor force has contracted dramatically.  And this isn't really tracked well.  In '20-'21 there were massive spikes in new company registrations, so a lot of people left the workforce to start their own little gigs, likely in many cases with zero rate debt for startup costs, and those likely aren't being tracked that well.  The stock market, which is essentially all very large companies, feels this strain the worst, because the only way they are going to keep up is by offering higher wages from the bottom to the top of their employment pay scales.  We will likely see continuing white-collar job cuts and continuing pay and benefit raises at the bottom, which vastly out number the top.  There is very little incentive these companies can provide without higher pay.  And no Fed changes will help this.  The job market is going to persist at a very tight state, the demographics demand it.  


All that will happen is that the Fed will tighten, even into real positive rates of 6-7%, and eventually the issue will be servicing US debt as a percentage of GDP.  It will hit a point, stop, and the pivot won't happen for a very long time back into easy monetary policy because the stagnation of the labor pool and avenues for self-employment contradict the large corporate structure that has existed to this point.  My personal investment thesis right now is to maintain exposure in solid, mature companies, preferably with dividends, emerging market exposure into places with positive demographic trends (India, South Africa), and buy bonds when the fed announces a stop to rate hikes because I think they will largely outperform the market in the 2-5 year term until the pivot to rate cuts (probably 2H 2024) due to political pressure and the ever increasing appetite by the general populace for entitlements.  
At that point, buying TLT will be how somebody could get very, very wealthy and since that is not some secret anymore, that could re-ignite the entire cycle.  Because it will happen at that scale.  Institutional money will absolutely clobber that trade.",2022-12-06 16:46:08
What is an 'inverted yield curve' and why does it matter?,24,ze843q,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ze843q/what_is_an_inverted_yield_curve_and_why_does_it/,8,1670336738.0,"source: [https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-and-why-does-it-matter-1.1855134](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-and-why-does-it-matter-1.1855134)

Short-term bonds are currently showing higher yields than long-term bonds in a reversal of the typical pattern. As of Monday, the yield for two-year short-term bonds were pegged at 3.8 per cent, while 10-year bonds yielded 2.8 per cent.

What does the trend mean, and why does it matter?

**WHAT IS IT**

“Inverted yield curves are very bad news,” said Duke University Finance Professor Campbell Harvey, who is credited with discovering the relationship between inverted yield curves and economic growth. The model has reliably preceded recessions in the U.S. and Canada over the last few decades.

A positive yield curve slope is good for economic growth, while “flat or negative is bad,” Harvey said in a phone interview. That reading has allowed the model to act as a reliable early warning signal for a recession.

Harvey explained that long-term bonds usually have higher interest rates than short-term ones, with a “premium for taking on longer-term investments” which are generally considered riskier.

But sometimes the pattern reverses, due to factors like people dropping riskier assets like stocks and investing in government treasuries which are considered safer, he said.

Another possible factor is rising inflation, which leads central banks to drive up the short-term interest rates in response. Central banks in both Canada and the U.S. are taking that tactic at the moment, and Harvey noted that the policy direction has led to economic slowdowns and recessions in the past.

University of Toronto economics professor Angelo Melino said the yield curve reflects what markets think will happen, and at the moment it shows an anticipation of falling interest rates.

“It's telling you that people think either we're going to get less inflation in the future or we'll get lower real interest rates in the future because of a recession, or both,” he said in a phone interview.

**POSSIBILITY FOR A SOFT LANDING**

Research published in October by the Conference Board of Canada pointed to [**September and August yield curve data in Canada**](https://www.conferenceboard.ca/insights/featured/canadian-economics/probability-of-a-recession-next-year) as a sign of declining investor sentiment and negative market outlook – but noted that the pattern “does not necessarily indicate that a recession is on the cards.”

“What the inversion of the yield curve tells us is that investor sentiment has dampened, and the risk of recession has intensified,” Conference Board economist David Ristovski wrote.

In a phone interview on Monday, Ristovski noted that the yield curve inversion has grown since he published the analysis. His organization has pegged the risk of a recession occurring in the next 12 months as relatively high, but isn’t forecasting an outright recession. 

“We are calling for more stagnant growth rather than an outright technical recession,” he said.

Harvey said he sees room for an engineered “soft landing” given the current picture of the labour market with excess demand for labour helping some sectors bounce back quickly from layoffs. He also pointed to short-term inflation, which is currently sitting higher than what people expect in the long-term, as another “wild card” in the direction of economic growth.

“It is possible that we could dodge a recession in a technical sense and still have slow growth,” he said.

Melino said the inverted yield curve is a signal “like the canary in the coal mine” that hints at economic downturn to come, but it must be considered with other factors.

**WHAT SHOULD THE CENTRAL BANK DO**

The Bank of Canada is set to raise interest rates again on Wednesday in its final policy decision of the year.

Overnight interest rates currently sit at 3.75 per cent after several successive increases and economists are debating the size of what Wednesday’s rate move will be, with many predicting an increase of 25 basis points.

Harvey said he would advise central banks in Canada and the U.S. to introduce lower-than-expected rate increases to avoid overshooting their objective of lowering inflation. Continuing with rate hikes for longer than necessary could “(cascade) into a recession, and potentially the dreaded hard landing recession, which nobody wants,” he said.

“For me, they should exercise caution,” he said. “I'd probably pause the increases.”

Ristovski said he expects the Canadian central bank will raise its central interest rate one more time but with a smaller increase than its most recent hikes.

He acknowledged the risks of raising central interest rates too aggressively and too quickly, but said he expects the Bank of Canada will bring down inflation without doing too much harm to the economy.

“We believe that the Bank of Canada will succeed in lowering inflation and we believe that Canada will not enter a technical recession,” he said.",2022-12-06 16:25:38

# [Stock futures are little changed after Monday’s rout](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were little changed Tuesday, as traders took a breather after fears of even higher rates sparked a sell-off during the previous session.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 20 points higher, or 0.06%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose marginally higher.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite led Monday’s downward charge, dropping 1.93% for its biggest one-day drop since Nov. 9. The S&P 500 shed 1.79%, also notching its worst day in nearly a month. The Dow, meanwhile, lost 482 points, or 1.4%.
*****
> Better-than-expected November ISM Services data, which looks at the purchasing level of manufacturers as a gauge the health of the broader economy, pressured equities Monday. The report stoked fears that the Federal Reserve will need to hike rates for longer than anticipated to bring down inflation. The release aligns with the payrolls report late last week in pointing to resilience within some areas of the economy.
*****
> Wall Street is largely expecting a 50 basis point increase to interest rates at the Fed’s December meeting, but remain conflicted over how long the central bank’s interest rate hiking campaign will need to last, especially given the latest data.
*****
> Despite this backdrop, markets could still move higher in the months ahead, even though slowing growth and higher rates will persist even into the new year, wrote Jason Draho, UBS’ head of asset allocation, in a note to clients.
*****
> “A year-end rally may still be in the offing, though investors are likely to remain skittish until November CPI is released on the 13th and the FOMC meeting concludes on the 14th,” he said. “If there are no surprises with these events, momentum could continue.”
*****
> Investors will look ahead to data Tuesday morning on international trade for insight into the strength of the U.S. and global economy. Later in the day, they will watch for post-bell earnings reports from Smith & Wesson and Stitch Fix.

If the idea of callable is for the bank/issuer to just pull the rug and stop giving interest once  rates go down, why are there so many?  Why so much supply of these compared to non callable?
Do people buy it with the idea of being ok once it gets pulled?  Or are these sold later at a secondary market for a profit?

But I see these as two behemoths so entrenched in our technical infrastructure that they will not be left out of future growth. I see attractive entry points.

What I am looking to avoid: anything that is not turning a profit. As the economic landscape becomes more challenging I think stock prices will more and more reflect the financials and less the promise of big future returns 

My underdog moonshot: PARA. Great dividend yield. Low pe. Profitable and poised to eat some market share from big competitors

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Question about using instant buying power to make money,2,zdymkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zdymkn/question_about_using_instant_buying_power_to_make/,12,1670309862.0,"So almost all platforms give their members some form of instant buying power, meaning once you iniate a transfer/deposit into the brokerage account you can use X amount of that money to trade with even though the funds have not hit the account yet (and won't for another few days). So my question is let's say someone has a limit of $2,500 in instant buying power and they then 'deposit' 2500 into their account. Only problem is their bank balance is only a few hundred so the transfer won't go thru. However the brokerage account won't know the deposit got declined for a few days. Let's say in the meantime you use the $2,500 in buying power to purchase a stock on Tuesday and Wednesday its up 10%, so you sell it and make $250. You now have $2,500 buying power and $250 actual money in your account. What happens to the $250 you made in a couple days when the deposit doesn't go thru? Will your buying power be brought back to zero and the $250 remain in your account and allowed to be withdrawn? Can they just take that money? Not saying I'm going to do this as I have a somewhat decent portfolio, I've just always been curious as to how firms deal with this and how they protect themselves since anyone could potentially lose money they don't have any after a deposit bounces their account would be negative and the firm loses out.

Apple is a buy this month,0,zdy5gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zdy5gz/apple_is_a_buy_this_month/,23,1670308506.0,"Apple is home to some of the world's most coveted products, including the iPhone, Air Pods, the iPad, and its Mac lineup, to name a few. The high demand for its tech offerings drove the company to report revenue and operating income growth in its latest quarter despite significant declines in consumer spending throughout the industry. 

In Q4 2022, the iPhone manufacturer posted revenue of $90.15 billion, an 8.1% year-over-year rise and $1.38 billion more than previous analysts' forecasts.  Operating income increased 4.6% to $24.89 billion. 

Moreover, Apple has proven its position as one of the best growth stocks out there, with its shares rising 249% in the last five years despite a 19% dip in 2022. In fact, stock market star Warren Buffett has put 39.2% of **Berkshire Hathaway**'s portfolio into Apple stock, giving Berkshire a 5.8% stake in the company worth $135.3 billion.

In the coming year, reports say Apple will enter the $25 billion augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) market with a new AR/VR headset, fill out its Mac lineup with a larger iMac and beefier Mac Mini, and further grow its services revenue from recent price hikes. With its long-term plans to venture into even newer areas, such as folding phones and electric vehicles, Apple will likely continue to see significant gains for years to come. 

With $111 billion in free cash flow as of Sept. 30, a price-to-earnings ratio of 24, and some exciting developments in 2023, Apple is a screaming buy this December in the run-up to the new year. ",2022-12-06 08:35:06
Three reasons why I believe lows are not yet in,279,zdvx4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zdvx4k/three_reasons_why_i_believe_lows_are_not_yet_in/,353,1670302556.0,"I've been in cash since late 2021.  For some specific holdings, I was in cash a little longer.  I've ignored the urge to buy over the last several months despite a couple compelling rallies.  I believe we're headed lower in early 2023, and here's why.

1. Shiller PE has exceeded 30 three times in history (four if you count 2018 as a separate occurence): 1929, dot-com, 2018 and 2020-2021.  In every instance, a correction followed.  **We are still at 29.26.**  That is very expensive.  I'm not going to get into the details of why I think criticisms of Shiller PE are mostly misguided, but I think any criticism that could be levied is probably outweighed right now by the fact that we have the highest Fed Funds Rate of the last twenty years, and that should significantly impact the price we're willing to pay for earnings.
2. The terminal rate is now likely going to be higher than previously thought, yet the market hasn't adjusted.  In the September dot plot (page 4: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220921.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220921.pdf)), not a single FOMC member projected a terminal rate over 5%.  Last week, Powell himself said the terminal rate will be higher than projected by that dot plot, and we can probably back into that conclusion just by starting with the current rate target (3.75-4%) and adding in a couple very likely looming 50bps hikes.  Just those two hikes get us to 5%.  Does anyone honestly believe the Fed will be done at that point?  I can't imagine so.  While the path down to 5-6% on CPI might be somewhat easy, it's highly unlikely it won't take more to get to 2-3%.  I don't think stock prices are properly accounting for this material change in expectations and its corresponding real economy threat.
3. **Markets don't bottom before recessions begin.**  This hasn't happened a single time in the last 80 years (see for yourself: [https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data](https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data)).  While markets might bottom before a recession is declared, the beginning date of that recession (declared after the fact) has pretty much always been before the bottom of the market.  Does anyone think a recession will be declared to have begun in Q4 2022?  I can't imagine so with unemployment this low.  This is a point I see people get wrong all the time on this sub.  While it's true that stocks often head higher before recessions are over, they don't do so before recessions begin.

Those are my reasons.  Now feel free to throw all of your ""DCA is the way"" and ""If you wait for the robins, Spring will be over"" shoes at me.",2022-12-06 06:55:56
"Back to 50% cash in January?

190 million barrels dumped in three weeks! Crude Oil Position Collapse,131,zdsfw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zdsfw1/190_million_barrels_dumped_in_three_weeks_crude/,24,1670294008.0,"Portfolio investors sold off oil in a big way for the third straight week as investor concerns about potential disruptions to crude flows due to Russian export limits receded.

&#x200B;

Hedge funds and other fund managers sold the equivalent of 42 million barrels of the six most important oil-related futures and options contracts in the seven days ending Nov. 29.

&#x200B;

The sell-off in the last three weeks totaled 190 million barrels, surpassing the previous six weeks' buying volume of 169 million barrels. Fund managers have cut their NYMEX crude oil positions for three consecutive weeks.

&#x200B;

Analysis of the data shows that the decline in positions came mainly from fund managers cutting long exposure, rather than covering shorts. In the latest week, selling was again concentrated in crude oil (4 million barrels), particularly Brent crude (39 million barrels), with little change in other contracts.

&#x200B;

Brent crude is the contract most directly affected by Russian crude exports due to the price cap restrictions announced by the US, EU and their allies on December 2. Fund managers last week reduced their net position in Brent crude to just 99 million barrels from 238 million barrels on Nov. 8. The ratio of long to short Brent crude oil positions was just 2.17:1, down from 6.74:1 at the end of October. this is the lowest level since November 2020.

&#x200B;

Concerns that price caps will reduce global crude supplies appear to have triggered a wave of buying in the spot and futures markets throughout late September and early October. Precautionary buying pushed near-month Brent crude futures from $84 a barrel on Sept. 26 to a high of nearly $99 on Nov. 4. It also helped the futures market maintain a spot premium for up to six months.

&#x200B;

But as it became clear that this cap would be set at a relatively high level and executed in a more lenient manner, this buying behavior reversed, causing prices and spreads to fall sharply.",2022-12-06 04:33:28

My yearly performance is -36%. Which is due to the first half of the year being so so bad. But since I DCA’d the whole year my weighted performance is -5.3%.

> U.S. stock futures fell Monday as investors awaited more economic data ahead of the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting later this month.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 150 points, or 0.4%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off its second positive week in a row, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq advancing 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively. The Dow advanced 0.2% last week.
*****
> In other news, Tesla shares slumped more than 4% on reports of an output cut at its Shanghai factory.
*****
> Those moves came after Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that smaller interest rate hikes could start in December. The Fed is slated to meet Dec. 13-14 and is expected to raise rates by 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage points. On Friday, stronger-than-expected jobs report initially rattled markets, but traders later shook it off.

> Despite the recent rally, Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson said the risk-reward for equities has likely reached its cap as it nears the bank’s original tactical target range of 4,000 to 4,150.
*****
> “As suggested two weeks ago, for this tactical rally to go higher, back end rates would need to fall,” he said in a note to clients Monday. “Fast forward to today and that’s what has happened. However, we are now right into our original upside targets and we recommend taking profits before the Bear returns in earnest.”
*****
> On the economic front, investors are expecting the November ISM services data at 10 a.m. ET on Monday. Economists polled by the Dow Jones expected a reading of 53.7.

Are rating agencies incompetent or am I an idiot?,109,zcof2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zcof2m/are_rating_agencies_incompetent_or_am_i_an_idiot/,98,1670193918.0,"After some red flags I started taking a thorough look at ESG ratings and credit ratings for car companies. Still in a very early phase, but I want to share my results.

First I collected ESG data from two notable ESG rating agencies (MSCI & Sustainalytics) for 15 notable automotive companies with available data. When I calculated the correlation with each other they were not correlated (anti-correlated if anything, Pearson -0.25, p= 0.37). This indicates to me it is just random noise without intrinsic information.

Then I collected credit rating information from two notable credit rating agencies (Moody's & S&P) for 15 notable automotive companies with available data (same companies used for ESG analysis). These ratings were strongly correlated implying some underlying information (Pearson 0.65, p = 0.008). But when I then ranked these car businesses by their average credit rating Tesla scored the lowest with 2 billion debt, 20 billion cash & 10 billion yearly income. On the other hand business leveraged to the tits & flirting with bankruptcy (Toyota 210 billion debt, 50 billion cash, 20 billion yearly income, General Motors 110 billion debt, 20 billion cash, 10 billion yearly income) were scoring higher.

I realize more data can be collected and the numbers can be cherry-picked for a brighter picture, but overall this initial result paint a black and white picture: ratings = bullshit. What am I missing?

Thanks redditors! :)

EDIT1: I have gotten a lot of feedback on things that are missing & an interest in nuance. 

I agree there's is a lot that can be done, my original plan was about 1000x more ambitious. Will update when I get to it. For now I have added p-values.

As for nuance, I would just like to say I am so impressed by all the points here. I wrote it down in a way I thought would be engaging in the hope of some feedback and engagement which I definitively got! But I agree it can be packaged differently; breeding on this for now.",2022-12-05 00:45:18

The Buffett indicator - Everything you need to know,16,zchv0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zchv0s/the_buffett_indicator_everything_you_need_to_know/,15,1670179627.0,"The Buffett indicator is ""probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment"" - This is a quote by no other than the legendary Warren Buffett.

The goal of this post is to explain what this indicator is, how it is being calculated, the logic behind it as well as the challenges that come with it.

Let's get started!

**What is the Buffett indicator?**

In one sentence, it is a simple ratio between the market cap of the public companies within a certain country and the GDP of the same country. So, what does this ratio tell us, how should one read it?

To best understand the logic behind it, let's go to the extremes and imagine that there's a country with the following assumptions

1. All companies are public.
2. The country is isolated (does not trade with any other country)

If this is the case, the market cap would represent how much one should pay to buy ALL of the companies that are out there. These companies are also responsible for the output of the goods and services that are measured through the GDP.

Over a long period of time, this ratio would give us an idea of whether the stock market is expensive or cheap, which is the purpose of this indicator.

Of course, in reality, these assumptions aren't true.

For the US, the Buffett indicator is being measured by taking the Wilshire 5000 (a market-cap-weighted index of the market value of American stocks traded in the US) as it includes a majority of the common stocks and REITs and it is being compared against the US GDP.

Back in the 1950s, a normal ratio (where the stock market is fairly valued) was around 45%. Today, 70 years later, a normal ratio is considered around 120%. (Note, the % mentioned are only applicable to the US)

So, why is this ratio increasing over time? There are 3 arguments to touch upon:

1. There are more public companies over time - This is the weakest argument as there are also companies that are being de-listed for various reasons)
2. International sales impact market value, not GDP - This is a strong argument. Numerous companies create value outside of the US and that is captured in their market cap. However, this isn't captured in the GDP of the US.
3. Technological advances combined with increased productivity increase profits - This is also a strong argument. If a company manufactures chairs and discovers a new more efficient and effective ways to make the same chair, well, the output is the same, so there won't be any change when it comes to the GDP. However, the margins will increase, which means higher profits, and that of course leads to a higher market cap.

**Can the indicator be used for countries other than the US?**

The indicator can be calculated for almost all countries, but there are a lot of things to keep in mind.

1. It requires obtaining data for a fairly long period of time. A decade isn't enough if the stocks are expensive or cheap throughout the entire decade.
2. There's no % as a benchmark that can be used to assess whether the stock market is expensive or cheap. This is an indicator that provides insights once it is compared to itself at a different point in time.
3. Events that have significant value should be identified. These are rare, but there's an example of Aramco, one of the largest public companies, which became a public company a few years ago. Of course, this had no impact on the GDP of Saudi Arabia, but it added 7 trillion Saudi Riyal (around $2 trillion) to the market cap.
4. If public companies contribute a fairly low % of the GDP, the indicator is almost useless

**How useful is the indicator?**

In the past,  it is quite clear that the indicator can remain around 1 standard deviation (above and below) for an extended period of time. However, on only two occasions did it reach the height of 2 standard deviations in this millennium. Once, during the dot-com bubble and the second time at the last peak in 2020/2021. In both cases, there was a correction fairly soon.

This might be another tool in the arsenal for the individual investor to assess where the market is.

**The criticism**

However, in my opinion, this indicator should be used in combination with other relevant financial data. The indicator is rightfully criticized for ignoring the interest rate. Of course, this has a significant impact on the valuation of the companies. Although there were 2 occasions where the indicator showed the market was significantly overvalued, in the first case (with the dot com bubble), the 10-year Treasury rate was over 6%. In the second case, it was closer to 1%.",2022-12-04 20:47:07

Congress poised to pass marijuana banking reform in lame duck,2358,zcaln8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zcaln8/congress_poised_to_pass_marijuana_banking_reform/,260,1670162922.0,"The Senate appears to have reached bipartisan consensus on the SAFE banking act, a bill that would open the federal banking and financial system to marijuana businesses that operate legally according to their state's law.

[The Senate plans to attach this marijuana legislation to one of the year end ""must-pass"" bills, such as the NDAA.](https://www.axios.com/2022/12/03/senate-marijuana-legislation-chuck-schumer)

Some additional notes:

1) The SAFE banking act has passed the house 6 times but has always died in the Senate. The most recent attempt last year was killed by progressives in the Senate who view the SAFE banking act as an easy win for investors/bankers while not doing much for those impacted by the war on drugs. A deal has been reached to include the HOPE act along with SAFE, which provides federal funding for states to expunge prior cannabis offenses, appeasing the demands of the progressives.

2) The NDAA is expected to be voted on this week, meaning we should see some major headlines regarding this cannabis legislation as soon as Monday.

What does this mean for cannabis stocks?

1) Aside from the news catalyst itself, the SAFE banking act should have a material impact on the financials of many of these cannabis companies. The language of the final version of SAFE is still unknown, but the core of the bill has always been to provide safe harbor for financial institutions to work with cannabis companies that are operating legally within their state. At the bare minimum, this will open the capital lending market to these companies, enabling them to get better terms on debt.

2) This will also provide safe harbor for hedge funds or other large institutions that may be interested in investing in the space but are unable to for compliance reasons. 

3) Finally, the US cannabis companies (MSOs) cannot currently trade on the major US stock exchanges like the NYSE and NASDAQ. There is some back and forth as to whether SAFE will allow these stocks to finally uplist, given that these are financial depository institutions. Many believe that yes, SAFE will allow these companies to uplist at least on the TSX (Toronoto Stock Exchange) and likely even the NASDAQ/NYSE, and there could even be special language added to the final bill to specify this.

Value traps: When good P/E doesn't mean good investment,27,zc6o57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zc6o57/value_traps_when_good_pe_doesnt_mean_good/,20,1670150923.0,"P/E ((stock) price per earnings) is an important tool for investors. Still, there are cases where having a strong P/E doesn't necessarily mean it's a good investment. These are sometimes referred to as Value Traps, which is a bit of a buzzword but we might as well.  

Here are some examples of factors that can 'ruin' the investment prospects of a healthy P/E:   
-The earnings are misleading: companies can shuffle around their numbers to make it appear better for short term gain.  
-The company is losing market share. It might be doing alright this year, but earnings are likely to shrink in the future, making it a bad investment.  
-The company is in a shrinking sector. Very similar to declining market share, but instead of a smaller piece of the pie, the entire pie is shrinking.  
-Unsustainable stakeholder relations. A company that overworks its employees, burns bridges with its suppliers, or otherwise mismanages a company in order for short term gain will not be a good investment.  
-Peak earnings. The company itself is fine, but this year's earnings are because of a peak in the cycle. If your company is in a cyclical industry, it might make more sense to use the average earnings per cycle in your price to earnings analysis, rather than the current earnings.  
-Strategy and innovation. A failure to adapt to the changing needs of the market can turn a good value company into a bad future investment. Classic blockbuster tale.  
 -External interference. When new laws get passed, these might affect the industry you're investing in. Other sources of interference could be activist groups, unions, the media, rival corporations with large sway on the market, etc.  

Basically what I'm trying to say is this: Sometimes the current earnings are not indicative of future earnings, and as an investor you should be wary about this. A strong P/E is only a good indicator if the earnings are grounded and sustainable.

Would it be dumb to buy $ZIM right now?,45,zbzmiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zbzmiv/would_it_be_dumb_to_buy_zim_right_now/,47,1670125797.0,"Okay so if you haven't heard of ZIM before, it is an Israeli shipping company that did exceptionally well during COVID.   


I owned ZIM for less than a year and made a 19% gain through dividends and broke even on the stock price itself. Now, the stock is much lower and has an insanely low valuation/dividend. It has a trailing P/E of only 0.44 (less than two quarters to net profit their entire market cap) and a massive dividend of 130%. Just two weeks ago the dividend was 110%. At the height of ZIM, it was $90 per share and it IPO'd at $11 a share in 2021, while it is currently only $19 per share. Even if revenue falls (which it has just slightly started to do) I still believe the company has a very low valuation. I could hypothetically hold until the next ex-dividend date and make a 25%+ gain. Would this be a stupid play?   


I do not currently own any shares of $ZIM",2022-12-04 05:49:57
Are generous severance packages masking the declining job numbers?,16,zbyzfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zbyzfi/are_generous_severance_packages_masking_the/,22,1670123858.0,"There have been tens of thousands of layoffs the past couple of weeks (most reports indicate it's in tech companies) which typically involve severance of 3 months or even 16 weeks with full benefits. If you are collecting severance I assume you don't count as unemployed until your severance runs out and you start actively looking for a new job. 

When the initial jobs numbers came out this week there was a massive sell off market open and early in the morning, but the market bounced back near closing. Although the numbers were strong on paper, there was a weird disconnect between the headline number and the household survey. Where the headline number shows over 250k jobs added, but the household survey shows a -138k drop in employed which seems to stem from a massive -186k drop in labor force participation.

Also although hourly pay went up .6%, the stats also show that hours worked also went down. Which seems odd.",2022-12-04 05:17:38

Apple has accelerated plans to shift some of its production outside China,1290,zbtscx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zbtscx/apple_has_accelerated_plans_to_shift_some_of_its/,144,1670109237.0,"In recent weeks, Apple Inc. has accelerated plans to shift some of its production outside China, long the dominant country in the supply chain that built the world’s most valuable company, say people involved in the discussions. It is telling suppliers to plan more actively for assembling Apple products elsewhere in Asia, particularly India and Vietnam, they say, and looking to reduce dependence on Taiwanese assemblers led by Foxconn Technology Group. Turmoil at a place called iPhone City helped propel Apple’s shift. At the giant city-within-a-city in China, as many as 300,000 workers work at a factory run by Foxconn to make iPhones and other Apple products. At one point, it alone made about 85% of the Pro lineup of iPhones, according to market-research firm Counterpoint Research.

The Zhengzhou factory was convulsed in late November by violent protests. In videos posted online, workers upset about wages and Covid-19 restrictions could be seen throwing items and shouting “Stand up for your rights!"" Riot police were present, the videos show. The location of one of the videos was verified by the news agency and video-verification service Storyful. The Wall Street Journal corroborated events shown in the videos with workers at the site. Coming after a year of events that weakened China’s status as a stable manufacturing center, the upheaval means Apple no longer feels comfortable having so much of its business tied up in one place, according to analysts and people in the Apple supply chain.

“In the past, people didn’t pay attention to concentration risks,"" said Alan Yeung, a former U.S. executive for Foxconn. “Free trade was the norm and things were very predictable. Now we’ve entered a new world.""

Home repairs will continue and Lowes gain significant returns from the funds they reinvest, cheap grocery store alternatives will expand imo, Autozone is in countries where electric cars are non-existent and has room for international expansion imo, and lastly quality but cheap Coffee alternatives to places like Starbucks will thrive even in recessions.

Amazon’s cloud unit faces cost-sensitive customers as economic fears mount,103,zbq9l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zbq9l8/amazons_cloud_unit_faces_costsensitive_customers/,62,1670100529.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/03/aws-faces-cost-sensitive-customers-at-reinvent-as-economic-fears-mount.html

Amazon Web Services has been the biggest growth engine for its parent company over much of the past decade, taking business from some of the largest tech vendors in the world. But as corporations face the most daunting economic environment since the 2008 financial crisis, those massive checks they’re writing to AWS for their tech infrastructure are getting greater scrutiny. Peter Kern, CEO of online travel company Expedia Group, sees the cloud as an area where his company can reduce its fixed costs. In recent years, Expedia has moved considerable parts of its operations to AWS from on-premises data centers. “We haven’t fully optimized the cloud,” Kern said during the company’s earnings call last month. “We’ve moved a lot of technology into the cloud, but we have a lot of work to do.”

The National Football League, which uses AWS to produce statistics and schedules, is making conservative plans around costs, said Jennifer Langton, the NFL’s senior vice president of health and innovation. “We are not recession proof,” Langton told CNBC during an interview at AWS’ annual Reinvent customer conference in Las Vegas this week. The league is negotiating with AWS on the terms of a renewed multi-year agreement, and there are some areas her organization wants to prioritize, she said. AWS is coming off its slowest period of expansion since at least 2014, the year Amazon started reporting on the group’s finances.

AWS isn’t the sole big cloud provider that’s dealing with customers’ budget constraints. In the third quarter, Microsoft’s Azure consumption growth moderated as the company helped clients optimize existing workloads, finance chief Amy Hood said in October. Amazon leads the market in cloud computing, with an estimated 39% share. “If you’re looking to tighten your belt, the cloud is the place to do it,” AWS CEO Andy Selipsky said during his keynote presentation in front of over 50,000 people on Tuesday. Selipsky said that moving IT jobs to the cloud could help budget-strapped organizations save money, citing customers Agco and Carrier Global.

Not everyone agrees. Last year, investors Sarah Wang and Martìn Casado of venture firm Andreessen Horowitz published an analysis, showing that a company could trim its computing costs by half or more by bringing workloads from the cloud back to on-premises data centers. Selipsky told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in an interview that AWS teams are working with customers that are trying to become more efficient. “We do see some customers who are doing some belt-tightening now,” Selipsky said. One example is data analytics software maker Palantir, which said last month its operating profit in the third quarter was higher than expected primarily because of cloud and deployment efficiencies.",2022-12-03 22:48:49
So will Jumia become the “Amazon” of Africa? Or is it a pump and dump Ponzi scheme?,264,zbkxm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zbkxm7/so_will_jumia_become_the_amazon_of_africa_or_is/,155,1670087058.0,"Jumia was an interesting stock back in 2020/2021, seemed like everyone was talking about it in the bull market. After seeing success stories like Mercado Libre and Sea Limited I couldn’t help but buy a few shares of Jumia around $20. The problem is that you sort of have to believe in the African growth story for the thesis to work out long term. 

It seems like Africa lacks the infrastructure to handle logistics, like there are not even street addresses in some areas of Africa. Many countries have weaker financial institutions including a large unbanked population without checking accounts. And the internet penetration rates can be really low in some countries. 

I feel like at certain inflection point of development in emerging markets there will most likely not be a country or region that will be an exception to increasing e-commerce adoption. But even though Jumia as a first mover advantage, I’m not sure if they’ll be the company to revolutionize e-commerce in Africa if wide e-commerce adoption is even possible in Africa at the moment. 

Do we think that the bull thesis is still intact for Jumia. Or is it a sell?",2022-12-03 19:04:18

So like a lot of people seemed to suggest at that time, I just started buying VWCE mindlessly every month.. My problem was that I started reading/educating myself about investing only after I already started with it. I had absolutely no idea what the hell I was getting by buying VWCE, I was just promised I would be rich one day. After a few months, a couple of books and a lot of research I finally understand what I am actually buying with my money. Now, while I do think that VWCE isn't actually a bad choice, I don't think it's the right choice for me. I am planning on selling all my VWCE shares and start over.

Here's what I came up with and hopefully people can comment on my choices, and maybe recommended better options?

60-80% VUSA

10-20% Some Emerging Markets fund - not sure which one

10-20% Individual small P/E ratio stocks

I think this is a bit more riskier than just VWCE but that's kinda what I'm going for.

Also; I use IKBR as a broker, but I noticed that they take a small cut when buying a stock, like a euro or two.. It could add up over the years... Should I maybe switch to Trading 212? They advertise Commission-free investing, so since I'm selling all my shares, might as well transfer now that I have the chance?",2022-12-03 13:06:01

# **S&P 500 and Nasdaq end Friday lower after November jobs report; indexes notch weekly gains - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
> Stocks cut much of their earlier losses Friday as investors looked past hotter-than-expected labor data to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up just 34.87 points, or 0.1%, to 34,429.88 points after hitting a session low of more than 350 points down. The S&P 500 dipped 0.1% to 4,071.70, rebounding from an earlier loss of 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite also made up ground to end nearly 0.2% lower at 11,461.50 points. The tech-heavy index dropped as much as 1.6% earlier in the day.
*****
> All three indexes set weekly gains, with the Nasdaq posting the largest increase at nearly 2.1%. The S&P 500 added 1.1%, and the Dow ticked up by 0.2%. Friday’s close marked the first time the three major indexes notched back-to-back weekly gains since October.
*****
> Stocks dipped after labor data released Friday morning showed payrolls rose by 263,000 in November, a bigger gain than the 200,000 increase expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. Average hourly earnings also came in above expectations, jumping 0.6% compared with the prior month and 5.1% against the same month a year ago. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%.
*****
> The market quelled much of those losses as the trading day went on. Market observers attributed the move to investors being increasingly able to shake off concerning individual economic indicators following remarks on Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that appeared to confirm slowing rate hikes starting as early as December.
*****
> “Just one strong labor data point is not going to be enough after Powell’s speech,” said Anna Han, vice president at Wells Fargo Securities. “He’s confirming that we are seeing the trend that we are having an impact on inflation, so I think that sort of soothes the market and takes pressure off.”
*****
> It was the final monthly employment report before the Fed’s two-day meeting Dec. 13-14, in which the central bank is expected to slow to a 50 basis point interest rate hike from the 75 basis point hikes seen in recent months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bd27a1ab99c3a122fd055c369cb12cf7/378af1d4ed5f33f3-99/s500x750/1909a4cfe63b634b8e837a88ef1087914fe19c28.jpg))**

> There was a stat floating around the internet and business news channels this week that stated when the S&P 500 was down 15% or more year-to-date (YTD) on November 30 December was down >2% on average. We ran the numbers yesterday before the big rally on Fed Chair Powell’s “makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases” comments yesterday at the Brookings Institute.

> What we found was that most of the carnage after November YTD losses > 15% occurred in the Great Depression years and since WWII December has performed much better after a down >15% YTD November. During the Depression after these November YTD >15% losses December was down 3 of 4 with an average loss of -5.4%. In the six years since 1939 with these November YTD >15% losses December was up 3, down 3 with an average loss of -0.3%.

> But with the big 3.1% gain in the S&P 500 on November 30, the YTD loss receded above the -15% mark to -14.4% on the heels of a 5.4% gain for the month, which is also a 14.1 percent rally off the October 12 low. And this marks the first back-to-back monthly gains of over 5% each month since August 2020, the ones before that were in March-May 2009. It’s the 14th such occurrence since 1950. The previous 13 all occurred in bull markets.

> Now, when the S&P 500 is down YTD November less than 15%, December’s performance is not so bad at all, just a tad below the average 1.6% to 1.1%, up 17 of 23 or 74% of the time. We still expect some chop as the bull market finds its footing, but we remain bullish and anticipate the yearend rally to continue to climb the proverbial “wall of worry” and for the Santa Claus Rally to come to town.

> # Country ETFs Outperforming US Recently

> For most major global equity markets, at some point this Fall a 52-week low has been put in place, with significant rallies since then. As shown below, of the 22 ETFs tracking key country stock markets in our Global Macro Dashboard, the average gain off the low is now 22%. The largest of these rallies have come from Germany (EWG), Italy (EWI), and China (MCHI), which have all risen over 30%. For China, that gain has come in the shortest span of time with October 31st being its low, whereas Italy and Germany's lows were a few weeks further back. One other interesting note regarding China is currently it trades only slightly above its 50-DMA whereas a majority of other country ETFs are in or at least near overbought territory. On the other end of the spectrum, the US (SPY) has experienced the most modest rally having only risen 13.82%. India (INDA) is close behind with a 13.89% gain, although it bottomed before the rest of the world with its 52-week low being back on June 17th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120122-GMD-1.png))**

> While much of the rest of the world has experienced a larger rebound off the lows, year to date performance between the US (SPY) and global equities excluding the US—proxied by the MSCI All World ex. US ETF (CWI)—is now very similar. The US is marginally in the lead with a -14.12% YTD total return versus a 14.45% drop for CWI. At the lows at the end of Q3, international markets were underperforming the US by more than 5 percentage points, but that gap has been closed during the current rally.

> # Five Good Signs for The Bulls In 2023

> Can you believe it? We made it to December! As we noted yesterday, we wouldn’t be surprised if we finished this year with some more green, but today we’ll look into the future and what could be in store in 2023.

> First things first, let’s start with something simple. Stocks will likely be lower this year; we can all agree there. How likely is the S&P 500 to be down two years in a row? The bottom line, it is pretty rare for back-to-back yearly losses, and we don’t expect it to happen this time either. In fact, over the past 50 years, it has only happened twice. There was a three-year losing streak after the tech bubble burst in 2000, 2001, and 2002, then back-to-back losses during the vicious recession of 1973 and 1974. So it ‘could’ happen, but we don’t see many similarities between now and those two times, suggesting next year should be a bounce-back year for stocks.

> Another potential positive is that when the S&P 500 is lower during a midterm year (like we will likely see in 2022), the following year has been extremely strong. Since 1950, the year after a negative midterm year saw the S&P 500 higher all eight times, with a very impressive yearly return of 24.6%. Looking at the past 50 years, things are even better, as the ‘worst’ next year was 26.3%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture1.png))**

> Thirdly, and somewhat similar to above, pre-election years historically are very strong for stocks, with the S&P 500 up 16.8% on average and higher 88.9% of the time. Midterm years are the worst, which clearly played out this year. All in all, that’s something for bulls to be excited about in 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture2-800x407.png))**

> Fourth, we hear a lot about how a recession is coming in 2023, but we aren’t so sure. Sonu did a great job discussing some of this here and here.

> The bottom line to us is that the consumer makes up 70% of the economy, and is still in good shape and spending. But could a recession start next year? Well, history would say it would be rare. That’s right, we found that out of the past 13 recessions, none started in a pre-election year. Full disclosure, we did see recessions begin in January in 1970 and 2008, so those were just a month away. But all in all, this is another potential positive for the bulls in 2023.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture3.png))**

> Lastly, stocks soared yesterday as investors realize that the Fed will likely end their series of aggressive rate hikes potentially quite soon. As a result of yesterday’s big move, the S&P 500 closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time in more than seven months. We took a look, and this could be potentially quite bullish.

> As you can see here, previous times that saw streaks end at least six months beneath the 200-day moving average resulted in solid performance going forward. In fact, since 1950, only one out of 13 times stocks went on to make new lows, which was in 2002.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture4.png))**

> Here are the longest streaks beneath the 200-day moving average and what happened once the streak ended. Up 18.8% a year later and higher more than 92% of the time is one thing that could have bulls smiling in 2023.

> # Will Santa Bring Jolly or Coal to Investors This December?

> Can you believe it? We’ve made it to the last month of the year! I don’t know about you all, but I’ll be pretty happy to wish 2022 goodbye as soon as possible. But the good news is that we continue to think the mid-October lows were the lows from the bear market, and continued good times could be coming. I’ll break down some positive signs tomorrow on the blog, but today I’ll show why there’s a chance Santa will come to town and bring some green with him this December.

> First things first, December is historically known as one of the best months for investors, and this is true. Only once did the S&P 500 see December turn out to be the worst month of the year. That was in 2018 when the Fed made one rate hike too many, and investors weren’t very festive about things, sending December down a record 9.2%.

> As the chart shows below, December is still up over the past ten years (so including that massive drop in 2018), and that is mainly because the past three years, this final month has gained 2.9%, 3.7%, and 4.4%, respectively. Looking further, it ranks as the third-best month since 1950, with only April and November better. In fact, until 2018, this month was historically the best. Lastly, in a midterm year, October is the best month, November is the second best, and December is the third best.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MicrosoftTeams-image-1-800x338.png))**

> Some other things to know:
> * When stocks are down for the year heading into this month, December has been higher eight of the past nine times.
> * Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years, the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013.
> * Midterm years have been worse lately, down a record 9.1% last time (in 2018) but also down in 2014. At least we’ve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years.
> * When stocks are up in both October and November (which could be the case this year as long as we don’t see a massive drop today), the S&P 500 doesn’t do quite as well in December, up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54%, suggesting the prior months could be taking some of December’s historical strength.
> * Lastly, only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the S&P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time, and it caused massive selling, but this month is usually quite calm, and big drops are rare.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE #2!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dec-worst-mo-of-year-800x339.png))**

> The bottom line is that with inflation likely peaking, the U.S. dollar weakening, positive seasonals, a potentially more dovish Fed, investors still extremely bearishly positioned (bullish from a contrarian point of view), broadening overall market participation, a stronger than expected consumer, and crude oil back to near flat for the year, there are many former headwinds, which have now become potential tailwinds. When all is said and done with 2022, we wouldn’t be surprised to see this year end higher than where it is today.

> # A Popular Recession Indicator is Flashing Bright Red. Should We Worry?

> A political strategist once said that if there were reincarnation, he would want to come back as the bond market. “You can intimidate everybody,” as he put it. With good reason, investors watch bond markets carefully for all sorts of signals about the economy, monetary policy, and inflation.

> And right now, a key signal from the bond market – the yield curve – is flashing bright red, warning about impending recession. The yield curve is simply a curve showing interest rates on US treasury bonds across various maturities. Yields on the short end of the curve, i.e., smaller maturities, typically rise and fall depending on what investors expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to do over the next year or two. Interest rates on the long end of the curve, with maturities of 5 years or more, are typically higher than those on the short end. If investors anticipate higher growth and inflation, they will demand much higher interest rates, widening the “spread” of difference between short and long-term yields.

> In extreme cases, we get inverted yield curves, with short-term rates higher than long-term rates. This normally does not make intuitive sense since it implies that long-term investors, who face more uncertainty and risk, are settling for less compensation than short-term investors. It typically happens when the Fed raises interest rates to prevent overheating of an economy (like they have this year), while bond market investors kind of take the opposing view – believing that the Fed will go too far and push the economy into recession, which would be accompanied by much lower inflation and hence, lower long-term yields.

> The yield curve inverted prior to the last ten recessions, with just one false signal in 1965. The table below shows yield curve inversions (as defined by the 10-year/1-year spread turning negative), along with the timing of the recession that followed. No surprise that this is a favored recession indicator.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-yield-curve-inversions-table-800x679.png))**

> The chart below shows how the 10-year/1-year spread has gone negative prior to the shaded bars, i.e., recessions. The bad news is that this spread inverted back in July of this year and is currently at its most negative, or “inverted state,” since 1982. Indicating a recession is on the horizon if you consider the historical precedent.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-picture-yield-spread-602x800.png))**

> # What does it really tell us, beyond “Yes, Recession”
> One thing you notice from the table and chart above is that while a recession has followed inversion, the degree of inversion doesn’t say anything about the following:
> * When a recession will start – the start time has varied from 7 to 24 months
> * How long the recession will last – we had prolonged recessions in 1974 and 2008, and the degree of inversion was quite different prior to these
> * How deep the recession will be – the degree of inversion was similar prior to the 2001 and 2008 recessions, but these were very different economic drawdowns
> Another huge caveat I would add to the track record: the inversion in 2019 technically preceded the 2020 recession, but it didn’t really “predict” it in that it didn’t predict Covid-19.

> Also, the yield curve has a bit of a dubious record outside the US, as this study from the St. Louis Federal Reserve points out. Several yield curve inversions occurred in the U.K. and Canada that did not predate recessions, i.e., you had a lot of false signals. But it worked better in the US, France, and Germany.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-st-louis-fed-study-inversions-800x575.png))**

> # A symptom rather than a cause
> Yield curve inversion is more of a symptom rather than a cause. The logic is that the Fed tightening too far leads to an expectation of slower economic growth (or recession), which leads to lower inflation expectations (there’s less demand for goods and services). Which in turn results in long-term yields falling below short-term yields. To a first approximation, long-term yields are simply the expected path of future short-term rates, i.e., monetary policy. And so, if inflation is expected to be lower in the future, especially amidst a recession, you would expect the Fed to reduce rates.

> Note that higher rates can take their toll on the economy. For example, housing activity can decline amid higher mortgage rates, and businesses may cut back on spending/hiring if they find borrowing terms to be much higher. But these usually occur only with a lag – which is why a recession doesn’t follow immediately after the Fed raises rates and yield curves invert.

> # Look toward inflation expectations
> With respect to yield curve inversions, a lot of it comes down to inflation expectations. Inflation expectations can fall if investors expect a recession.

> But, longer-term inflation expectations can also be lower than short-term inflation expectations if inflation has surged recently and investors believe it to be a short-term phenomenon. Sound familiar?

> It’s not easy to directly gauge inflation expectations, but we can calculate them using securities called inflation swaps. Without getting into too much detail, these are used to transfer inflation risk from one entity to another. You have swaps ranging over various periods, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, which can tell you what investors expect inflation to average over these periods.

> The chart below shows 1-year inflation expectations versus 1-year/9-year forward inflation expectations. The latter is the inflation expectation over the 9-year period that begins one year from now – my goal is to separate short-term inflation expectations from longer-term expectations. As you can see, 1-year inflation expectations surged above longer-term expectations over the past 18-20 months. Prior to 2021, the 1-year/9-year forward expectation was mostly above the 1-year. But they’re converging again, with investors expecting inflation to average about 2.7% over the next year. At the same time, the 1-year/9-year forward expectation is just under 2.6%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-inflation-expectations-592x800.png))**

> What also comes out of the graph is that during the 2008 and 2020 recessions, 1-year inflation expectations collapsed well below the longer-term series. Based on that, it doesn’t look like markets are expecting a recession now.
> * 1-year inflation expectations are still slightly above the 1-year/9-year forward inflation expectation
> * 1-year/9-year expectations have barely fallen, in contrast to what we saw in 2008 and 2020 when they were below 2%
> Could we be headed for stagflation, i.e., a recession with high inflation? Well, the 1-year/9-year forward expectation is around 2.6% right now – it doesn’t exactly scream stagflation, let alone high inflation.

> To wrap up, the yield curve may be as inverted as it is today because the Fed is hiking short-term rates even as long-term yields fall on the back of lower inflation expectations – in a sense vindicating the rate hikes. However, there are other factors, including a reversal of supply-chain-related issues that pushed inflation higher in the first place. My colleague, Ryan Detrick, and I have written quite a lot about why we think inflation is off the boil (see here and here).

> And just as important, inflation expectations beyond a year are not pointing toward a deflationary recession or stagflation, for that matter.

> Of course, investors could be wrong, and things could change in a hurry. This is something I’ll be watching closely.

> # Typical December Seasonal Pattern Begins Dull Pops Mid-Month

> December’s first trading day has been bearish for S&P 500 and Russell 1000 over the last 21 years. A modest rally through the fifth or sixth trading day also has fizzled going into mid-month. It is around this point that holiday cheer tends to kick in and propel the indexes higher with a pause near month-end.

> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect, 2023 Almanac pages 112 &114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2023 Almanac page 18), which states as the S&P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.

> The “Santa Claus Rally” begins on the open on December 23 and lasts until the second trading day of 2023. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. The “Santa Claus Rally,” (2023 STA p 118) was invented and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 in the Almanac.

> This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. As Yale Hirsch’s now famous line states, “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

> # December #2 Small Cap #3 Large Cap Tepid Start Solid Finish

> Trading in December is holiday-inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins.

> December is the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% and 1.6% respectively. It’s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and fourth best for NASDAQ (1971). It is also the third best month for Russell 1000 (1979).

> In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 does not seem highly likely this year.

> When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/622df92caae1f1d36246081b8c04ec3f/19c407a38165e76c-b2/s400x600/a5ece9d71341061ea8853d22d94d38c5b51b9519.jpg))**

> In the last eighteen midterm years, December’s rankings slip modestly to #5 DJIA (0.9%), #3 S&P 500 (1.2%) and #7 NASDAQ (–0.3% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also tend to soften in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just three times in ten midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is 0.3%. Midterm December performance had been stronger prior to previously mentioned December 2018.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Of course there still variation like what the fund manager does and market demands etc, but in large, they are relative ""sane"", am I even right?

If I am right (kind of), assuming inflation has stopped completely. Assuming the feds has decided to not raise rate at all (these are all assumptions, for education purpose). What is the expected behavior of prices of bond funds? Are they supposed to just hold? Go up? Or keep going down just less so?

Tesla Semi doubts,637,za7o0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/za7o0i/tesla_semi_doubts/,780,1669946246.0,"Tesla Semi *delivery* event has happened, the first delivery actually happened yesterday to Pepsi. 

500 mile range at 82,000 lbs real world test. Right off the factory line, onto the road. There was no aero package added and no weight change, and the truck only stopped once so the driver could use the bathroom. 

During this real world test, brakes were actually cold at the mandatory brake check on route. Which is in place so drivers that normally would have extremely hot brakes don’t end up experiencing brake failures due to high temperatures. This is because the regenerative brake system on the Tesla semi works extremely well, to the point where the brakes are almost not needed. Think of it kind of like an engine brake on a diesel truck, but instead of just slowing down the truck it now also charges the battery. 

Price was not discussed, weight was not discussed. 

It’s clear that this will operate extremely well on shorter routes with its current range, but will not be as useful on larger trips. The argument can be made that laws don’t allow drivers to drive continuously without breaks, but the Semi is still a little short even with these breaks accounted for. I imagine as battery density gets better this will change. Along with the fact that these electric semi (on paper) will be *far* cheaper to operate, possibly offsetting downtime (charging time) costs. 

Over the average lifetime of a Semi, Tesla semi can save $600k to a million+ just in fuel. (Depending on charging rates) That doesn’t account for possible (and highly likely) maintenance cost savings. 

TLDR: Tesla Semi is a beast and obvious choice for anything under the ~500 mile routes, as routes get longer more consideration will be needed. 

Also to all the doubters, Tesla may be late, wrong, or seem completely insane sometimes but I think it’s fair to say that they do deliver.",2022-12-02 03:57:26

What do you guys think about this strategy whit turbos that doesn't require you to know which way the price is going? The idea is to buy lets say 1000kpl of long turbos for brent oil with knock off at 86 so you pay about 1€ per turbo so total of 1000€ and while doing that simultaneously you buy same 1000kpl of short turbos with knock off at 88 so you pay same 1000e for them. You are expecting some big news on oil but don't know which way so this way if it goes little up or down you basically stay at 0 loss or profit but if price chages more than euro to one direction you will make profit. And to add to this cost wise my broker doesn't have trading fee for turbos if transaction done is over 100e.",2022-12-02 00:29:22

"What stocks will flourish during U.S. ""Reshoring"" trend?",54,z9xm3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z9xm3d/what_stocks_will_flourish_during_us_reshoring/,69,1669924031.0,"Here are my thoughts please feel free to contradict/supplement me since I'm by no means any kind of expert or even moderately knowledgeable in this subject.

I think reshoring is going to be a strong trend given that:

* It would be a popular rally cry from both political parties. It would be very popular cause especially in manufacturing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, etc -- some of which are possibly swing states.

* The more unrest we see out of China and Russia, the more this concept will gain support.

* Some big companies will want to shore up their supply chain (e.g. maybe like car companies with semiconductors). They will lobby hard for this.

* Labor unions should also love this as more manufacturing = more jobs and more union members.

Some effects might be:

* Inflation. Reestablishing manufacturing is going to require initial investment in building factories

* Our labor is more expensive than China's. The labor market is already tight on the supply side right now, if we were to create millions of well paying labor jobs this might create scarcity of labor (will this trigger wage-price spiral)?

* Retaliatory trade wars. Our legislations encouraging re-shoring might be interpreted as anti free trade which may trigger China to launch their own protectionist rules, causing a cycle of hostility (although arguably this was going to happen anyway).

* Revival of a living-wage labor class, or middle class.

So what kind of companies will benefit from this? 

* Companies that help other companies build factories, infrastructure, etc (Like Catepillar).

* Companies that create automation -- like Tesla robots? (I'm sure there's dozens of better companies just serving as eg.)

* Companies that help improve logistics -- like software robot companies, Nvidia, etc.

* Companies that serve a middle class that was shrinking, but maybe will start growing again. Like Target maybe?

* Companies that will build homes around these new factory towns. 

SO what kind of companies will get hurt from this? I'm actually not sure.

Would love your thoughts on any of this, **but especially what companies will benefit/hurt the most and why**?",2022-12-01 21:47:11

Do you follow the same principles as Warren Buffett? Charlie Munger? Ben Graham? Peter Lynch? Michael Burry? Etc.

Why OKTA is up 26% today,8,z9s5ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z9s5ym/why_okta_is_up_26_today/,24,1669911987.0,"Okta (OKTA) raised its revenue forecast for fiscal 2023 and boosted its profitability outlook by “approximately $66 million at the high end.” 

Okta Inc. executives on Wednesday predicted profitability for all of next fiscal year, trumping profit concerns stemming from recent sales-operation issues. CFO Brett Tighe said Okta expects a non-GAAP operating loss of $39 million to $41 million. Factoring in an uncertain macro environment Chief Executive and co-founder Todd McKinnon said the company is not providing any forecasts past 2024.

Sales-rep attrition has been the lowest it has been in the past several quarters, following a spike last quarter. 

“What we’ve done over the last six months is what a lot of companies are doing, slowing hiring, re-evaluating real estate, doubling down on the things we know are high value. And some of the things that are maybe less value we’re doing less of, so that’s where we see the profitability come from,” McKinnon. 

Much of that comes from addressing the company’s struggle in combining Okta’s salesforce with sales reps acquired in the May 2021 acquisition of identity-platform Auth0, which is more focused on direct-to-user sales than Okta’s corporate focus.

“We still have work to do,” McKinnon said. “We don’t think we’ve solved it after one quarter of a positive trend but I do think it’s progress.”

“The biggest factor: We’ve really done a much better job clarifying the products and the positioning and saying we have two clouds: We have Workforce Identity Cloud and Customer Identity Cloud and it’s very clear what to sell when,” he said.

Help with this buyout of a company whose stock I hold...

Taylor Maritime Investments Limited (TMI.L on the London stock exchange) is buying Grinrod Shipping ($GRIN) for about $26 per share. Yesterday, GRIN announces that they will pay the shareholders of record on 11/25/22 a special dividend of $5 per share (about 18%). The price of the stock promptly resets to about $21 per share (yesterday). Then TMI will pay shareholders $21 per share to buy up their stocks. That looks as if some of the capital gains were converted to income, which is a wash in terms of numbers but giver me a higher tax bill. I don't understand the purpose of the special dividend, or what, if anything I'm supposed to do. If I don't do anything, will the stock be converted to TMI stock? TMI trades on the London exchange; it's TMILF over the counter in the US. 

I've had small companies' stock being bought up by another company before, and I log in to find a mysterious ticker in my portfolio. They tend to do very well over the long run & make big gains. But this sale looks like a wash to me. Am I missing something?

Grinrod shipping is a good company & has had 3 companies competing to acquire it this year. It also pays about a 15% dividend, which should happen in early December (will that still happen tho? or is the special dividend replacing that dividend?). So I'm inclined to hold...

Siemens Energy put out an offer to purchase the remaining Siemens Gamesa (SGRE) shares. They already own 67 %.

Inflation rose in October about in line with estimates, sending a sign that price increases at least are stabilizing, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index, a gauge that excludes food and energy and is favored by the Federal Reserve, rose 0.2% for the month and was up 5% from a year ago. The monthly increase was below the 0.3% Dow Jones estimate, while the annual gain was in line.

The gains also represent deceleration from September, which saw a monthly increase of 0.5% and an annual gain of 5.2%.

Including food and energy, headline PCE was up 0.3% on the month and 6% on an annual basis. The monthly increase was the same as September, while the annual gain was a step down from the 6.3% pace.

The department also reported that personal income jumped 0.7% for the month, well ahead of the 0.4% estimate, and spending rose 0.8%, as expected.

While the Fed takes in a broad range of measures to gauge inflation, it prefers the PCE index as it takes into account changes in consumer behavior such as substituting less expensive goods for pricier items. That’s different than the consumer price index, which is a raw measure of changes in prices.

Policymakers view core inflation as a more reliable measure as food and energy prices tend to fluctuate more than other items.

In other economic news Thursday, the Labor Department reported that weekly jobless claims totaled 225,000, a decline of 16,000 from the previous week and below the 235,000 estimate.",2022-12-01 16:14:00

Fed Chair Powell says smaller interest rate hikes could start in December,1755,z8zew5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z8zew5/fed_chair_powell_says_smaller_interest_rate_hikes/,414,1669833873.0,"*  **Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed Wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead and could start in December.**
* **But he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation.**
* **“We will stay the course until the job is done,” he said during a speech in Washington, D.C. at the Brookings Institution.**

WASHINGTON – Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed Wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead even as he sees progress in the fight against inflation as largely inadequate.

Echoing recent statements from other central bank officials and comments at the November Fed meeting, Powell said he sees the central bank in position to reduce the size of rate hikes as soon as next month.

But he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation.

“Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability,” Powell said in remarks delivered at the Brookings Institution.

The chairman noted that policy moves such as interest rate increases and the reduction of the Fed’s bond holdings generally take time to make their way through the system.

“Thus, it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down,” he added. “The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.”

Markets already had been pricing in about a 65% chance that the Fed would step down its interest rate increases to half of a percentage point in December, following four successive 0.75-point moves, according to CME Group data. That pace of rate hikes is the most aggressive since the early 1980s.

What remains to be seen is where the Fed goes from there. With markets pricing in the likelihood of rate cuts later in 2023, Powell instead warned that restrictive policy will stay in place until inflation shows more consistent signs of receding.

“Given our progress in tightening policy, the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level,” Powell said.

“It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time. History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” he added. “We will stay the course until the job is done.”

Powell’s remarks come with some halting signs that inflation is ebbing and the ultra-tight labor market is loosening.

Earlier this month, the consumer price index indicating inflation rising but by less than what economists had estimated. Separate reports Wednesday showed private payroll growth far lower than expected in November while job openings also declined.

However, Powell said short-term data can be deceptive and he needs to see more consistent evidence.

For instance, he said Fed economists expect that the central bank’s preferred core personal consumption expenditures price index in October, to be released Thursday, will show inflation running at a 5% annual pace. That would be down from 5.1% in September but still well ahead of the Fed’s 2% long-run target.

“It will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining,” Powell said. “By any standard, inflation remains much too high.”

“I will simply say that we have more ground to cover,” he added.

Powell added that he expects the ultimate peak for rates – the “terminal rate” – will be “somewhat higher than thought” when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee members made their last projections in September. Committee members at the time said they expected the terminal rate to hit 4.6%; markets now see it in the 5%-5.25% range, according to CME Group data.

Supply chain issues at the core of the inflation burst have eased, Powell said, while growth broadly as slowed to below trend, even with a 2.9% annualized gain in third-quarter GDP. He expects housing inflation to rise into next year but then likely fall.

However, he said the labor market has shown “only tentative signs of rebalancing” after job openings had outnumbered available workers by a 2 to 1 margin. That gap has closed to 1.7 to 1 but remains well above historical norms.

The tight labor market has resulted in a big boost in worker wages that nonetheless have failed to keep up with inflation.

“To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2% inflation,” he said.

Setting up mother’s inheritance portfolio,34,z8zdba,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z8zdba/setting_up_mothers_inheritance_portfolio/,111,1669833780.0,"Hello. My mother recently came into a sizable inheritance and I’m trying to set her up to live off the money. The total inheritance is about $2.2 million and it was all in MSFT. 

We sold all but about $60k in MSFT and because of the adjusted cost basis she technically took a loss so she shouldn’t need to worry about capital gains on that sale. 

She’s in a bad situation and desperately needs a new home, new car, furniture etc. She gets disability income of about $800 per month. 

After the sale we set up a purchase of $100k into Schwab’s S&P500 fund (SWPPX)

I’d like to help her invest at least $1.2m into a decent retirement portfolio and use the rest to get a home and car and such and then see what remains. 

My question is what stocks/funds and bonds would be good for a retirement income portfolio? 

Should she purchase individual bonds or bond funds? Any general advice on which positions to take would be appreciated, thanks.",2022-11-30 20:43:00
Can I use my employee stock purchase plan to basically make 15% for free ?,193,z8wqvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z8wqvd/can_i_use_my_employee_stock_purchase_plan_to/,132,1669827807.0,"Hi all. So my employer offers ESPP via paycheck deduction. From Jan 1 - June 30. I am limited to 15% of my paycheck. 

From what I can tell, there is no holding period. The section for “When can I sell?” Says “The plan does not impose a holding period for sale of shares but there is a hold period for transitioning to an independent broker of two years to track disqualified distributions”. 

Does this mean I could just contribute max, sell when the shares are issued on a June 30th, and withdraw the cash to my savings account? The shares are bought at a 15% discount.

Why the market feels like it’s rigged even though it isn’t. And why you shouldn’t try to time the market.,0,z8venl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z8venl/why_the_market_feels_like_its_rigged_even_though/,44,1669824643.0,"When you buy a stock, you are never buying it at the bottom. Out of 365 days in the year, there is only one “bottom”, and every day up to that bottom was a “mistake” to buy. And every 365 days has only one “top”, and selling every day up to that day was a “mistake”. It’s easy to think that you’re terrible at timing the market, but statistically speaking, the odds are very high (like 99% chance) that the market will drop below where you buy in at some point, and will rise above where you sold at some point. 

And if you believe the algo’s can grab your shares and then push the prices up, or sell you shares and then push the price down to cover their naked sales, you’re probably right, but that doesn’t mean the system is rigged; that’s just a mechanism the market has to create more liquidity. The system works fine. You can make money. Eventually, good companies and good stocks will rise. 

So if you want to be happy in the stock market:

1. Do not try to time the market unless you are playing the trading game, which is a game most will lose at. Instead, the solution is to dollar cost average into the market, or buy stocks that are clearly good deals and wait it out. Over time, you will win by going long into a diverse group of high quality companies and index funds. 

2. Buy companies and industries that you understand and are comfortable with. If you know a company well and are comfortable with it, then a drop in price is a discount. Just wait it out and you’ll eventually be higher. 

The market is not rigged. Eventually, markets WILL rise. And trying to time the market will do nothing but cause frustration (unless you employ tools like charting, and watch the technicals). 

Hope this is helpful to someone.",2022-11-30 18:10:43

# [S&P 500 futures are flat as Wall Street awaits Powell speech on economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures were flat on Wednesday as Wall Street awaits an afternoon speech on the economy from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
*****
> S&P 500 futures were essentially little changed, with the benchmark looking to snap a 3-day losing streak. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 18 points. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1%.
*****
> Traders were hit with two reports Wednesday morning that caused volatility in stock futures. On one hand, a labor report signaled the job market could be cooling, raising hopes the Federal Reserve would slow its aggressive rate-hiking campaign. On the other hand, an updated reading of third-quarter gross domestic product was released and it showed the economy was stronger last period than first realized.
*****
> Payroll processing firm ADP said Wednesday that private companies added just 127,000 positions for the month, well below the 190,000 consensus estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones.
*****
> But the Bureau of Economic Analysis also said Wednesday that third-quarter GDP increased at a 2.9% annual rate, according to its second estimate. That was revised higher from the 2.6% first estimate.
*****
> Powell will give a speech at the Brookings Institution this afternoon that may give further insight into the central bank’s thinking on future interest rate increases. The Fed is slated to meet later this month and is largely expected to deliver a smaller 0.5 percentage point rate hike after four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases to tame high inflation. Any signal of a pivot on future rate hikes would likely send markets higher.
*****
> “This is a Fed-made recession, so eventually when he does pivot, the market should move higher pretty quickly,” said Steve Grasso, CEO of Grasso Global, on CNBC’s “Fast Money” Tuesday.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a mixed session. The Nasdaq Composite shed 0.59% and the S&P 500 lost 0.16%, marking the third straight negative day for each. The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a marginal gain, closing 3.07 points, or 0.01%, higher.
*****
> Stocks have been weighed down by China’s zero-Covid policy and have failed to fully recover from losses even as the country announced steps toward reopening, such as an uptick in vaccination rates for the elderly.

"Euro zone inflation falls for first time in 17 months, bolstering hopes for smaller ECB hike",337,z8p73c,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z8p73c/euro_zone_inflation_falls_for_first_time_in_17/,55,1669807940.0,"https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2022/1130/1339160-euro-zone-inflation-falls-for-first-time-in-17-months/

The annual rate of inflation across the euro area eased back to 10% in November, according to an initial 'flash' estimate from the EU’s statistical agency Eurostat.

This compares to an annual rate of 10.6% recorded in October and is the first fall in the rate of inflation in 17 consecutive months.

The main contributor to inflation remains the cost of energy but the annual rate of energy price increases slowed last month to 34.9%, down from 41.5% in October.

However, food inflation accelerated slightly to 13.6% from 13.1%.

The rate of inflation for industrial goods and services remained steady.

Core inflation, which strips out energy and food prices, also remained steady at an annual rate of 5%.

Ireland’s estimated harmonised index of consumer prices also fell back to 9% from an annual rate of 9.4% in October.

According to a statement from the CSO, the energy component of Ireland's 'flash’ estimate of inflation rose by 0.1% last month and slowed to an annual rate of 43%.

This compares to a jump in energy prices in October of 13.6% and an annual rate of energy price inflation of 47.6%.

The CSO will publish the Consumer Price Index for November next week.

The European Central Bank meets later in December when it's expected to raise interest rates again. Speculation continues over whether that rate rise will be 0.5% or 0.75%.

With inflation running at more than five times its 2% target, the ECB has raised interest rates at its fastest pace on record this year and a string of hikes over the coming months is still likely as price growth will take years to tame.

But after back-to-back 75-basis-point moves, some policymakers have recently made the case for a 50 bp rise on 15 December, arguing that inflation is finally peaking and that the ECB has made enough progress to justify more modest steps.

While the dip in headline prices, the euro zone's first in well over a year, strengthens the case for more measured ECB action next month, Wednesday's data could also fuel fears that inflation will prove more persistent than expected.

Underlying price growth, excluding volatile food and energy prices, remained high, which is likely to trigger warnings from conservative central bankers, while food price growth, a key concern for governments, shows little sign of peaking.

Filtering out food and fuel costs, inflation rose to 6.6% from 6.4%, defying expectations for a drop, while an even more narrow measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco held steady at 5.0%.

Inflation for processed food, alcohol and tobacco, a key category, meanwhile accelerated to 13.6% from 12.4%.

Another complication is that economic growth is not suffering as much as some had anticipated, so the deflationary impact of a looming winter recession is likely to be more modest than once thought.

Initially fuelled by supply bottlenecks in the post-pandemic reopening, inflation is now driven by soaring food prices after a poor harvest and sky-high energy costs in the fallout of Russia's war in Ukraine.

It may still edge back up in the coming months, especially at the turn of the year when energy contracts get repriced, but it is likely to decline through 2023 and return to the vicinity of 2% by the end of 2024.

Such a rapid decline lacks historical precedence, some policymakers warn, suggesting that today's small decline is unlikely to be a game-changer for where rates end up over the cycle of monetary tightening.",2022-11-30 13:32:20

Understanding the Volkswagen group (together),26,z8nd7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z8nd7w/understanding_the_volkswagen_group_together/,18,1669801665.0,"I am not invested in car companies, but I keep an eye open for opportunities. If I had to pick one, I would say volkswagen looks promising. Its the dominant player in Europe, with a decent penetration of the US and Asian markets. Solid brands, decent profit margins, and a quite varied offerings of electric options, with billions of invesmtents on the way. Of course it also includes cool luxury brands like Porsche, Bugatti, Lamborghini and so on. I did not buy in yet because their corporate structure is a mess. 

Let's see what is on the market.

1. Volkswagen group common stock: This stock gives you a partecipation in the whole group. Looks like the easiest option. Market cap around 85 bbln, P/E 4,4 and is gonna pay a special dividen of 19 euros. Like seriously? Why?

2. Volkswagen preferred shares: Are always referred to the group but they give you an higher dividend.

3. Porsche Automobile Holdings: Is an holding company which holds some percentage of the volkswagen group (31%) and 53% of the voting rights. Half of it and all the voting rights are owned by the Porsche family. The market cap is 10bln euros, and the stock price moves very differently from the one of the volkwagen group, I have no idea why.

4. There is talk about a Porsche AG IPO, and I am not sure how this will have an impact on the owners of the volkswagen group.

I am sure there is soo much more to learn about the group. Am I getting it right soo far?  What is the role Porsche in the company? Does the company looks promising to you?",2022-11-30 11:47:45

2. IMO, High flying specs should only encompass maybe 5% of one's portfolio.  So let's talk the other 95%.
3. Buy and hold is categorically inferior to tactical asset allocation (TAA) where TAA trades/rebalances once a month.  Takes 20 minutes and 100% rules driven.
4. Folks generally have no framework for making investment decisions.  If your investment rules ain't written down, then they ain't real, and becomes news and emotion driven which is not good.
5. Many younger folks have limited choices with company 401K's but still have no tactical framework for how to allocate assets.
6. A better sleep at night solution is what I use, which is Allocate Smartly.  I'm a paying member there and not associated with them in any other way.
7. I asked them to set up a user blog thingy like reddit but they didn't want to go there, so I opened a subreddit myself and seeded it with a bunch of what I think is useful stuff.

So, Disney investors and followers, will we see a dividend in the coming weeks under Robert Iger?

"With Regards to the Question Earlier, Whether Markets are Rigged ...",0,z84tdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z84tdd/with_regards_to_the_question_earlier_whether/,28,1669753042.0,"To u/Timelord1000 and others who may be interested in some ideas on this phenomenon ...

It's not that they're trading against you specifically. Insider HFs and MMs sometimes/often trade against the aggregate positions of retail and small fish. Usually they get away with it, but ocassionally some other big fish might catch them out. 

But the short answer is: YES. The game is rigged. Your trading platform very likely uses your data adversely against their customers; backroom deals are done with social influencers (Cramer anyone?); patterns and indicators can be set up specifically to appear a certain way.

**So let's make something abundantly clear ...**

Anyone who has done even a cursory glance at the 2008 catastrophe, should be shocked that not a single person went to jail over the vast fraud that was happening. And the regulatory captured revolving door bureaucracy systematically removed numerous regulatory checks on quite alot of activities. 

Taking this a step further ...

Corporate structures and codes are often game-able. Often the loopholes are written by the people who will exploit them, other times they just find gray areas to get around stuff that's *supposed* to be illegal. Still other times, like in 2008, there's some entities that are just ""too big to prosecute."" And/or these entities exploit some level of regulatory capture.

This is not a theory, this is not an opinion. This is absolutely a fact, and the history is unequivocal. *Slightly more theoretical is which companies are doing what kinds of activities that might be unscrupulous at any given moment*. 

Investigating tradfi insider / corporate structure is not my schtick, *so I'm not accusing any particular company/entity of any particular thing*. So chill a moment before smashing the downvote. 

Big fish feed on retail traders. There's alot to exploit. Some of it is legal, some of it isn't. Very little of the 2008 fraud was really dealt with or fixed (there were token measures, there always are). 

So be aware of these realities before putting your own money on the line in a trading environment.",2022-11-29 22:17:22

Microsoft likely to offer EU concessions soon in Activision deal -sources,23,z7z5ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z7z5ev/microsoft_likely_to_offer_eu_concessions_soon_in/,11,1669740429.0,"Microsoft [**(MSFT.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.O) is likely to offer remedies to EU antitrust regulators in the coming weeks to stave off formal objections to its $69 billion bid for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard [**(ATVI.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ATVI.O), people familiar with the matter said.

The U.S. software giant and Xbox maker [**announced the deal in January**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-buy-activision-blizzard-deal-687-billion-2022-01-18/) to help it compete better with leaders Tencent [**(0700.HK)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/0700.HK) and Sony [**(6758.T)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/6758.T).

It has since then faced regulatory headwinds in the [**European Union**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/eu-antitrust-regulators-probe-microsofts-69-bln-activision-bid-2022-11-08/), Britain and in the [**United States**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ftc-likely-file-lawsuit-block-microsofts-69-bln-bid-activision-politico-2022-11-23/), with Sony criticising the deal and even calling for a regulatory veto.

The deadline for the European Commission, which is investigating the deal, to set out a formal list of competition concerns known as a statement of objection is in January. Offering remedies before such a document is issued could shorten the regulatory process.

""Ultimately, such a move could secure an early clearance with the European Commission and subsequently be used by the parties before other antitrust agencies,"" said Stephane Dionnet, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery.

""However, it remains to be seen whether the active complainants will validate such concessions (in particular in terms of scope) and if behavioural remedies will also be accepted by the CMA and the FTC,"" he said, referring to the UK and U.S. antitrust agencies.

Microsoft's remedy would consist mainly of a 10-year licensing deal to Playstation owner Sony, another person with direct knowledge said.

Activision shares were up 2% after the Reuters story was published.

Goldman Sachs sees ‘high probability’ of OPEC cut — and expects oil prices to hit $110 next year,459,z7v4qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z7v4qy/goldman_sachs_sees_high_probability_of_opec_cut/,75,1669731017.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/29/oil-goldman-sachs-sees-high-probability-of-opec-production-cut-.html

A group of some of the world’s most powerful oil producers is highly likely to take further measures to stem a price decline and try to balance the market, according to Goldman Sachs. OPEC and non-OPEC producers, an influential energy alliance known as OPEC+, will convene in Vienna, Austria on Dec. 4 to decide on the next phase of production policy. It comes amid recession fears, weakening crude demand in China from renewed Covid-19 lockdowns and as market participants assess the looming impact of a Western price cap on Russian oil. Jeff Currie, global head of commodities at Goldman Sachs, said Tuesday that a combination of factors had led the bank to downgrade its oil price forecasts in recent months.

“First and foremost, it was the dollar. What is the definition of inflation? Too much money chasing … too few goods,” Currie told CNBC’s Steve Sedgwick at Goldman Sachs’ Carbonomics conference in London. The second factor “has to do with Covid and China — and by the way, it’s big,” he continued. “It’s worth more than the OPEC cut for the month of November, let’s put it in perspective. And then the third factor is Russia is just pushing barrels on the market right now before that December 5th deadline for the export ban.” Currie said the medium-term oil outlook for 2023 was “very positive” and the bank plans to “stick to our guns” with a $110-a-barrel Brent crude forecast for next year.

He acknowledged, however, that there’s “a lot of uncertainty” ahead. Oil prices have fallen in recent months. International benchmark Brent crude futures, which stood at $100 a barrel in late August, traded at $85.46 a barrel on Tuesday afternoon in London, up 2.7% for the session.  “Demand is probably heading south again in China given what’s going on,” Currie said. “I think the key point with China right now is the risk that you get a forced reopening. That means it’ll be self-imposed lockdowns where people don’t want to get on trains, don’t want to get to work and demand goes further south.” Currie said OPEC producers will need to discuss whether to accommodate further weakness in demand in China. “I think there is a high probability that we do see a cut,” he added.",2022-11-29 16:10:17

# [S&P 500 futures rise as China Covid concerns ease](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/28/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Futures connected to the S&P 500 rose Tuesday as worries over unrest in China and its Covid protocols appeared to ease.
*****
> The broad index’s futures added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.4%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded near flat.
*****
> The move follows stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai rallying overnight as a Chinese official told reporters that 65.8% of people “over age 80” had received booster shots. On top of that, the government reported the first decline in Covid infections within mainland China in more than a week.
*****
> Those updates follow the declines in U.S. and foreign markets seen Monday after protests in mainland China against the country’s zero-Covid policy started over the weekend. West Texas Intermediate crude futures briefly fell to their lowest point since last December while all three of the major U.S. indexes ended the day down more than 1% as investors grew increasingly concerned about if Chinese Covid protocols could hamper global supply chains.
*****
> “There’s some real reasons to be cautious. The market’s rallied a lot this quarter, and there’s some concerns that things are going to slow, so I think it’s a kind of balanced risk reward,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> “I think there was an excuse with maybe some China slowdown fears for people to collect a little profit that they made in the quarter,” he added.
*****
> On the economic front, traders will watch for the September reading of the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index that is due Tuesday before the bell. The report will give investors insight into how higher interest rates are affecting the housing market. Home prices in the prior month jumped about 13% year over year.
*****
> Meanwhile, the latest reading on consumer confidence is set to release at 10 a.m. Wall Street is also expecting the latest corporate earnings results from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Tuesday after the bell.
*****
> Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings on Wednesday. Investors will be listening for insight into the central bank’s fight against inflation.

META - The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated,29,z7sqcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z7sqcw/meta_the_reports_of_my_death_are_greatly/,96,1669724955.0,"I think it's fair to say that social media is at the moment one of the few topics where most of the population can agree to hate on. In this post I would like to deconstruct a few popular myths about Facebook/META and give my personal opinion on how I think the public image of this company has gone from bad to worse in recent history.

&#x200B;

Myth 1 - META is selling your data to advertisers.

I think this is a common misconception that a lot of people make simply because it's easy/convenient to understand META's business model like this. But reality is that META has NEVER sold any of its users data to advertisers in any of the platforms under its umbrella. Instead, when advertisers want their ads to be displayed on Facebook/Instagram, they request a target audience(things like age, occupation, interests, political orientation etc.) and pay META money. After the contract is signed, META will then use its internal algorithms and data to efficiently and accurately target ads requested by the advertiser. No personal data is transferred between META and the advertiser.

&#x200B;

One thing to add to this section is about the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2014. Facebook was not without blame of course, but they are not the main culprit. A third party app called ' This Is Your Digital Life ' improperly harvested data on 87 million Facebook users and then used that data for gaining political advantage in different election races. Facebook is guilty of improperly protecting their users data. Cambridge Analytica was basically doing the stealing while Facebook had a security issue.

&#x200B;

Myth 2 - No one is using Facebook anymore. Or at least people are leaving META's platforms in droves.

This is simply factually wrong. Global MAUs(Monthly Active Users) and DAUs(Daily Active Users) have been increasing every quarter since IPO. It is true that a slight decline started happening in Europe, while USA and Canada growth has basically stagnated(because already almost anyone is on one of the platforms). But META's reach is much beyond that. I cannot add images in this subreddit, but you can verify this yourself by searching for the MAU/DAU graphs in the last Q3 release.

&#x200B;

Myth 3 - META is investing all they have into the Metaverse.

This is again factually incorrect. Here is a direct quote from the CEO in the last conference call:

""We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q3, Family of Apps expenses were $18.1 billion, representing 82% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses grew 18% driven mostly by employee-related costs, infrastructure-related costs, and the impairment of certain operating leases for office facilities that we plan to exit. Our current surge in capex is largely due to building out our AI infrastructure and we would expect capex to come down as a percent of revenue over the long term. ""

We can clearly see that only 18% of expenses are directed to VR/AR aka the Realty Labs segment(also the nature of these expenses is that they should come down over time and margins will improve again). The rest of the expenses are going into the traditional apps like Facebook/Instagram/Messenger/Whatsapp.

People think that Zuckerberg and his team are lunatics that will throw the whole company in jeopardy because of some dream Zuckerberg had about VR/AR. Don't forget these guys have built a gigantic company with more than 3.6 BILLION users worldwide. They have also bought Instagram and Whatsapp(people were criticizing FB back when these acquisitions were made  ) and built them out into behemoths as well.

&#x200B;

Myth 4 - META is dying, financially speaking.

While it is true that recent earning releases were lackluster, people seem to not think about the cyclicality of the advertising business. Given the current economic struggles and the projected global recession incoming, do you know how majority of business cut their expenses?  At the top of the list is cutting advertising budgets. Add to this the recent iOS privacy changes and of course META has been struggling to show growth(especially after the increased growth after the pandemic).

Zuckerberg has already mentioned that the next leg in revenue growth will not be the Metaverse, but monetizing Messenger and Whatsapp:

' Beyond Reels, messaging is another major monetization opportunity. Billions of people and millions of businesses use WhatsApp and Messenger every day, and we're confident we can connect them in ways that create valuable experiences. We started with Click-to-Messaging ads, which let businesses run ads on Facebook and Instagram that start a thread on Messenger, WhatsApp or Instagram Direct so they can communicate with customers directly. This is one of our fastest growing ads products, with a $9 billion annual run rate. This revenue is mostly on Click-to-Messenger today since we started there first, but Click-to-WhatsApp just passed a $1.5 billion run rate, growing more than 80% year-over-year. '

Also, the metaverse doesn't have to take over the world in order for it to become a profitable investment.  Reality Labs has been mostly growing since 2020(at a loss) and only this year has META released the new VR headset . The growth is there, it can become profitable in the future and it doesn't mean that all of us will walk around with VR headsets and buy property in the Metaverse.

&#x200B;

Concluding thoughts - How did META's reputation got so bad?

Let me begin this by saying that I am in no way absolving META of any blame, they made/make mistakes. Their algorithms work in such a way that it brings to the surface some of the most over the top and toxic people/takes. It creates echo chambers that keeps its users engaged/addicted to its apps. At the same time I understand that the benefits that META brings to this planet, cannot come without the downsides, especially if you want to be using its services for free. You,the user, have to accept the terms and conditions that you will be the product.

I am not one to believe in conspiracy theories, I like to critically think why/how events unfold. Do you know who is also a player in the ad industry? Traditional media. It is in their direct interest if METAs public image is bad and advertisers pull their money out of META and give it to them. Same can also be said about Apple(they don't give a rat's ass about your privacy, they just want to get a bigger share of the advertising pie themselves ).

While so many other outlets will be benefiting from META's demise, it's easy to understand why a constant flow of bad news/coverage is coming towards META to destroy its reputation(worse than any other FAAMG company).

Because so many of us are using META and we all can see the glaring issues with its platforms, it's easy to hop onto a blind hate bandwagon that impairs our financial decision of whether to buy/not buy META stock without looking at the huge investing opportunity META is at its current prices.

EDIT:

Some people in the comments completely disregard the possibility of this being a great investment decision for the long term. Perhaps META being the most bought stock by superinvestors(great investors) in the last two quarters will make some to look past their biases.

Margin interest rates are a scam,0,z7sdd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z7sdd1/margin_interest_rates_are_a_scam/,39,1669723980.0,"When a broker charges you interest on your margin used, you are getting an extra hidden charge. 

Brokers have this tricky wording in their lending rates that allows them to charge more than their stated interest rate. 

Let’s look at Robinhood for example. They charge a “6.5% yearly interest rate calculated daily”. 

The key phrase here is “calculated daily”. This phrase allows them to charge you more than 6.5%! Now we have to factor in that they’re charging you daily (365 times).

Here’s the equation to calculate the effective interest rate: (1+6.5%/365)^365-1= 6.71%

Here we see the actual interest charged is 6.71% rather than 6.5%. 

All brokers use the same method of charging margin. 

This is the hidden cost of using margin! It applies to any APR lending, hence why APR stands for Annual Stated Rate. What they state vs what they actually charge you is completely different!",2022-11-29 14:13:00

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Thoughts on uranium etfs?

I am not convinced that the current supply shortages of uranium and the US and EU’s tepid consideration of nuclear as a sustainable/renewable energy source is enough to classify a uranium ETF a strong buy. Plants are still being decommissioned at a higher rate than new projects are being financed and I also don’t see the US and EU’s recent acknowledgment of nuclear as a steadfast commitment to the technology (to the same extent they are committed to wind/solar). Sure the uranium spot price has increased YoY but the price is still not high enough to justify the expansion of new more resource intensive extraction projects. Also I see the politicization of nuclear and the limited supply as a reason why it’s maybe not the future and could be seen as more trouble than it’s worth.

Anyway, this is my elementary view. Would love to hear alternative and opposing views as I do think nuclear is a decent alternative to fossil fuels and more reliable than renewables like solar/wind.",2022-11-29 00:17:15

The coincident indexes combine four state-level indicators to summarize current economic conditions in a single statistic. The four state-level variables in each coincident index are nonfarm payroll employment, average hours worked in manufacturing by production workers, the unemployment rate, and wage and salary disbursements deflated by the consumer price index (U.S. city average). The trend for each state’s index is set to the trend of its gross domestic product (GDP), so long-term growth in the state’s index matches long-term growth in its GDP.

The imugr link below is the percentage of states with a positive month-over-month growth minus those with a negative growth over the entire timeframe covered by the Philadelphia Fed.

**The only times we have gotten as low as we are now, we went into a recession. The Economy is weakening and when it has weakened to this degree this fast, things have not gone well.**

For reference :

1980 recession lasted from January 1980 – Jul-80

1981–1982 recession lasted from July 1981 – Nov-82

Early 1990s recession July 1990 – Mar-91

Early 2000s recession March 2001 – Nov-01

Great Recession December 2007 – June 2009

COVID-19 recession February 2020 – April 2020

The second imugr link below shows the number of states with negative month-to-month growth versus  positive month-to-month growth on one axis and number of states with ***significant*** month-to-month growth (excludes states with low growth) versus negative month-to-month growth on the other axis.  Dots in red are past months that fell within 6 months of a recession - months where we were in a recession or recovering from a recession have been removed from the chart.    The green line with dots are the last 6 month trend.  The latest ""October"" results are marked in text.

**If we do not go into a recession in the next 6 months, the ""October"" mark on the graph would be the first  time since the data series began in 1979 that the indicator has gotten this low without a recession following.**

“Don’t chase gains without an exit plan”

Throughout the end of the bull run, there were many companies I bought into. Some good, and some bad, but the common theme was I didn’t have a plan for exiting the position.
Some of my picks worked out great - locking in gains on pandemic high-flyers and rotating into a broad market ETF or cash.

Many of my picks, and sadly too many, were once high-flyers that fell sharply and have yet to recover. I look back and it’s clear I should have sold several, especially the stocks boosted on investment euphoria and will likely never hit those highs again, and just as likely to never hit where I purchased. Many of these, I sold for big % losses, even after being up huge % at certain points in time.

# [Stock futures fall as unrest in China grows over Covid restrictions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/27/stock-futures-slip-after-a-winning-holiday-week-.html)
*****
> Stock futures fell Monday as social unrest from China’s prolonged Covid restrictions weighed on markets, sending oil prices lower — after Wall Street notched gains during the Thanksgiving holiday-shortened week.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 178 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each dropped 0.7%.
*****
> Over the weekend, demonstrations broke out in mainland China as people vented their frustrations with Beijing’s zero-Covid policy. Local governments tightened Covid controls as cases surged, even though earlier this month Beijing adjusted some policies that suggested the world’s second-biggest economy was on its way to reopening.
*****
> The developments weighed on sentiment in Asia trading, with oil futures hovering around new 2022 lows around demand concerns. Shares of companies with big production facilities in the country led premarket losses. Shares of Apple lost 1.7% and Tesla declined 2.2% in premarket trading.
*****
> The moves come after all three major U.S. indexes ended last week higher, even with the shortened trading time due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow rose 1.78%, and the S&P 500 increased 1.53% during the short week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lagged the other two indexes but was still up 0.72% in the same timeframe.
*****
> Stocks were lifted during the week by comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that the central bank would step down its aggressive rate hike path as inflation cools. Minutes from the Fed’s November meeting confirmed the likely shift in policy.
*****
> “A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,” the minutes stated.
*****
> In the last week of November, investors will be watching more earnings reports and a slew of economic releases that will give further information on the state of the consumer and the U.S. economy. Intuit, Salesforce and Five Below are among companies scheduled to report earnings. Personal consumption data and the labor report for November will also be released this week.

**2022 S&P 500 Predictions**

Every year, Wall Streets’s top strategist make a call of where they think the S&P 500 will finish. We wanted to share a summary of some of these target prices for 2022 and the strategist reasoning for it. Remember to take these predictions with a grain of salt as markets are hardly predictable no matter how much of an “expert” you are.

**Morgan Stanley**

**Target Price-4,400**

**2022 performance: -7.7%**

While the firm still expects solid EPS growth next year, “uncertainty around that expectation goes up materially given cost pressures, supply issues, along with tax and policy uncertainty that is unique to the U.S.,” the analysts wrote in the note. With the rest of the world having lagged the U.S. recovery, the firm sees more “catch up” potential elsewhere and less earnings volatility over the next 12 months.

While Morgan Stanley does expect earnings for the S&P 500 overall to be solid, chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson expects “significant” earnings dispersion at the stock level, making the year more about stocks than sectors or styles.

**Wells Fargo**

**Target Price-5,200**

**2022 Performance: 9.1%**

Persistent supply shortages and inflation pressures lead us to adjust the magnitudes of some 2022 targets, but we believe the global economy should still mark an above-average pace next year. More importantly, our tactical preferences for the next 6 to 18 months are nearly all unchanged.

**Goldman Sachs**

**Target price-5,100**

**2022 Performance: 7%**

“Decelerating economic growth, a tightening Fed, and rising real yields suggest investors should expect modestly below-average returns next year.”

“In contrast with our expectation during the past year, corporate tax rates will likely remain unchanged in 2022 and rise in 2023. Corporate earnings will grow and lift share prices. The equity bull market will continue.”

“While we remain vigilant on margins, we don’t think it makes sense to assume the worst on this front given the strong track record that companies have had managing through cost pressures even before the pandemic.”

**Credit Suisse**

**Target Price-5200**

**2022 Performance: 9.1%**

“This constructive outlook is based on robust projections for economic growth in both real and nominal terms, further margin upside in cyclical groups, a pickup in buybacks and a favorable discount rate despite Fed tightening.”

**JP Morgan**

**Target Price-5,050**

**2022 Performance: 5.7%**

A JPM team led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, chief U.S. equity strategist, sees further stock upside ahead, albeit more moderate, on better-than-expected earnings growth, easing supply shocks, improved background on China (which JPM upgraded to overweight on expectations for policy easing and as equity risk premiums from regulatory moves are priced in) and emerging markets, normalizing consumer spending habits and, most important, accommodative central banks.

**BMO Capital Markets**

**Target Price-5,300**

**2022 Performance: 10.97%**

The bank believes that investors are too focused on inflation, which should moderate as supply chain kinks get straightened out next year. Combined with solid corporate earnings, that should continue to drive stocks higher in 2022, BMO analysts said. What’s more, the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet “will remain very large for quite some time, which should continue to be supportive of stocks.”

**RBC Capital Markets**

**Target Price-5050**

**2022 performance: 5.7%**

Like JPMorgan, the firm sees a slight gain for stocks in 2022, with heightened concern over rising Covid cases yet to derail the bull market. The new omicron variant is a reason for investors to “proceed with caution but not to panic,” RBC analysts said in a recent note. The firm did admit that there is likely to be more stock market volatility in the near term, especially as omicron could worsen ongoing supply chain issues.

**UBS**

**Target Price-4850**

**2022 Performance: 1.7%**

While stocks are “likely to have a pullback at some point,” strong corporate earnings and an eventual decline in Covid cases should help boost the market higher, the firm said.

How can inflation be brought under control when it seems like we are heading towards higher oil prices?,175,z62nt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z62nt4/how_can_inflation_be_brought_under_control_when/,193,1669559614.0,"Hi all,

As of writing this post WTI Crude sits at 76.28$. Excluding 2022, this is still the highest crude oil price we've had since 2014. 

Now add to this that USA is depleting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Europe is in a recession and China is still imposing lockdowns. All these factors belong to a BEAR thesis on oil as there is less demand for oil because of them.

Now I think it's not too exaggerated to expect that sooner rather than later that:

\- USA stops using the Oil Reserves as it will become a national security concern if it gets too low

\- Europe will see brighter days

\- China relaxes covid protocols(especially with the recent protests)

This should mean that whenever these things happen oil demand will be higher->higher oil prices(starting from already high prices)->higher inflation. 

How can the Feds be expecting lower inflation rate in the future given these factors? Am I missing something?",2022-11-27 16:33:34

Using the yield curves inversion as a tool for gauging recession risk is currently flawed,10,z5nka7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z5nka7/using_the_yield_curves_inversion_as_a_tool_for/,22,1669511668.0,"I just seen a post hit the page about how the yield curve is the most inverted it's ever been, and how we're in for an extremely bad recession. The truth is I don't know, but one thing I do know is that using the yield curve to back up this opinion is extremely flawed.

The reason why the yield curve is so inverted right now is because markets predict that inflation will be fought off by these increased rates. The belief seems to be that the speed of incline will be matched with a similar decline. Where this decline begins is what the market has been trying to estimate over the past 6 months, and it's been wrong each time.

That being noted, anyone expecting the yield curve to be anything other than inverted isn't really looking at what we know. We've seen that current rates have caused the CPI to fall 0.2% below expectations, quite a huge blow for future rate hikes. This means that current rates have finally helped to contain inflation. The next question will be whether we've gone too far.

When the next CPI results are released, they will dictate the shape of the curve. If we see an extremely low CPI result, we are most likely going to see an even more inverted curve, as expectations will grow on the Fed to maintain/lower current rates, meaning that long term bonds will face lower rates in the future. 

On the other hand, if the CPI numbers pick up, we'll see the yield curve more likely than not pull back, although we probably won't see it un-invert, simply due to the fact that there's a common belief that now might be the best time to invest in bonds. And where that belief exists, there's the belief that rates will not stay this high for long, otherwise why not wait another month?

We've already entered a technical recession, but personally, I don't see it being all that bad. Unemployment is still very low, inflation seems to be taming. To me, it looks like we may just end up having a few years of low growth.",2022-11-27 03:14:28

"Hedge fund Rokos warns that sterling is ‘vulnerable’ to further falls Brexit, deglobalisation and pandemic deal bigger shock to terms of tra",7,z4zybr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z4zybr/hedge_fund_rokos_warns_that_sterling_is/,3,1669443050.0,"Sterling looks “vulnerable” to further falls and the looming recession could have “serious” effects on British society, according to the hedge fund firm of billionaire trader Chris Rokos.

Rokos Capital Management, which manages around $14.5bn in assets, told its investors that the UK had suffered a bigger shock to its terms of trade than other developed countries because of the impact of Brexit, deglobalisation and the coronavirus pandemic.

Such a deterioration, which puts pressure on an already yawning current account deficit and can [fuel inflation](https://archive.is/o/OxtTs/https://www.ft.com/content/8981df2f-f723-4a1a-8044-0e7a3e4856a0), made it harder for policymakers to control consumer price growth, the firm wrote in a letter seen by the Financial Times.

“The recession that is required to tame inflation in the UK is deeper than that needed elsewhere, with potentially serious societal implications,” it said. “Sterling looks vulnerable.”

Rokos declined to comment further.

The gloomy diagnosis comes after a number of high-profile fund managers targeted the UK market. Odey Asset Management founder [Crispin Odey was among traders who profited from a plunge in sterling](https://archive.is/o/OxtTs/https://www.ft.com/content/d54b4915-60a2-4f73-b1b9-6ea4b7523dd9) in September following former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s “mini” Budget of unfunded tax cuts.

Rokos, one of the world’s biggest macro hedge funds, [profited during the UK’s gilt market crisis](https://archive.is/o/OxtTs/https://www.ft.com/content/e1960ff6-392f-4a09-94f2-bc60e2272ac6) in September, thanks to bets that UK borrowing costs would have to rise.

Sterling has [fallen more than 10 per cent](https://archive.is/o/OxtTs/https://markets.ft.com/data/currencies/tearsheet/summary?s=gbpusd) against the dollar this year and dropped to an all-time low of $1.035 in the wake of Kwarteng’s financial statement. Since then it has recovered strongly to around $1.21, its highest level since August.

Compounding the problem for Britain is the “disproportionately negative” hit that mortgage owners would take from higher interest rates, because fixed-rate home loans in the UK tend to expire more quickly than in other nations, such as the US. That, Rokos wrote, could mean that the Bank of England raises interest rates “too slowly to contain inflation”.

Rokos’s warning comes after highly bearish predictions from a number of other big-name managers. [Paul Singer’s Elliott recently warned](https://archive.is/o/OxtTs/https://www.ft.com/content/f3bb0f96-1816-4481-8318-4f7583326a4a) that the world was on the road to “hyperinflation” and could be heading towards its worst crisis since the second world war, while Saba Capital founder Boaz Weinstein has said global stocks could enter a Japan-style bear market lasting decades.

Rokos, a former co-founder of hedge fund firm Brevan Howard, has gained around 44 per cent in his fund so far this year. That puts him on track for his best year of performance since launch in 2015 and makes back large losses he suffered last year after being caught out by a sharp move in short-dated bonds.

His gains this year come during a fruitful period for macro hedge funds, many of which have been able to profit from a huge rise in government bond yields globally, as central banks raise interest rates to try to combat high inflation.

Rokos said that to be more optimistic on the UK’s outlook it would have to see “signs of a quietly engineered softer Brexit”, or higher immigration.

It also warned that, with a recession a “necessity” in order to tame inflation and cash becoming a viable alternative investment to financial assets, global stock markets look “exposed” to further falls.

Given there were “essentially fewer resources available and more investment is required, prospective returns need to be higher”, it wrote. This means that “asset prices need to be lower”.

How much longer will stocks be overvalued or is this the new norm?,23,z4z2vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z4z2vf/how_much_longer_will_stocks_be_overvalued_or_is/,90,1669440286.0,"I know there is value out there in the market, but as a whole (the sp500) the market is still overvalued compared to historical averages. Lately, I’ve found myself thinking that it seems bizarre how much of the market is trading at high multiples, but when you think about it, they are just ratios being compared to long term averages. So from my understanding (I’m 22 and don’t think I’m anywhere near an expert) there is no indicator saying for a fact the market is overvalued. Again we are just comparing rations like PE, P/S, P/B, etc. This got me thinking who’s to say we are overvalued? What if the new “norm” or long term average is, for example, a pe of 20 rather than around 14 or 15 for the overall market?

I’m studying economics in college and I know a lot of the ratios are pretty subjective. This is just an open ended question and just looking to discuss. Again, my level of expertise is pretty low imo so I’m not claiming this is a fact and feel free to correct me if I’m missing something key.",2022-11-26 07:24:46

How do you determine your Target Price?,5,z4v508,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z4v508/how_do_you_determine_your_target_price/,12,1669428430.0,"Edit: a commenter gave me the right term, so I’ll simplify my question: **What is your personal strategy for determining the intrinsic price of a stock?**

I always look at TipRanks for stocks’ target prices from analysts. I was doing this blindly, and that is wrong. So, I want to start educating myself on the topic of determining my own target price for a stock. 

Basically, what formula or approach should I use for determining what a good price for a stock is? Not necessarily a yearly target price, but what id a good $ value for the current stock. 

For example, I see MSFT at $242, and based on my study (which is the topic here)I feel a good price to own the stock at is $275. Good, then I start to scale into the stock. Then later based on a strategy I rework once a month for each stock (for example) I notice the fair price is less than I have, so I start selling as the price gets closer to my DCA. 

For reference, MarketBeat has MSFT’s ($242) price target at $300 meanwhile TipRanks average says $292. 



**So, my question to everyone is two fold:**

1. What strategy do you currently use to determine fair price for a stock, or a price target?

2. What resources would recommend for me to learn more about this topic?

Here are his 55 investing tips from Warren Buffett:**

&#x200B;

1. Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when others are fearful

2. Investing is laying out money now to get more back in the future

3. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.

4. Our goal is to find an outstanding business at a sensible price, not a mediocre business at a bargain price.

5. It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.

6. Never invest in a business you cannot understand

7. The value of a business is the cash it's going to produce in the future

8. If a business does well, the stock eventually follows

9. Ignore the stock market, ignore the economy, and buy a business you understand

10. A great investment opportunity occurs when a marvelous business encounters a one-time huge, but solvable problem

11. Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.

12. Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing

13. Diversification may preserve wealth, but concentration builds wealth

14. You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don’t do too many things wrong.

15. If you cannot control your emotions, you cannot control your money.

16. Look at market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy; profit from folly rather than participate in it.

17. Whether we’re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down

18. Cash combined with courage in a time of crisis is priceless.

19. Don’t pass up something that’s attractive today because you think you will find something better tomorrow.

20. In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is owning the S&P 500 index fund.

21. The Stock Market is designed to transfer money from the inpatient to the patient.

22. The true investor welcomes volatility... a wildly fluctuating market means that irrationally low prices will periodically be attached to solid businesses

23. Only buy something that you'd be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.

24. Our favorite holding period is forever.

25. If you aren’t thinking about owning a stock for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.

26. Time is the friend of the wonderful business. 

27. Much success can be attributed to inactivity. Most investors cannot resist the temptation to constantly buy and sell.

28. The three most important words in investing are margin of safety.

29. The investor of today does not profit from yesterday’s growth

30. In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it's a weighing machine.

31. Buy something for less than it’s worth

32. Widespread fear is your friend as an investor because it serves up bargain purchases

33. When investing, pessimism is your friend, euphoria the enemy.

34. The most common cause of low prices is pessimism, sometimes pervasive, sometimes specific to a company or industry. We want to do business in such an environment, not because we like pessimism but because we like the prices it produces.

35. The United States endured two world wars, other traumatic and expensive military conflicts, the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics, oil shocks, a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497

36. The years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines, even panics, that will affect virtually all stocks. No one can tell you when these traumas will occur

37. I think the worst mistake you can make in stocks is to buy or sell based on current headlines

38. Speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest.

39. The best thing that happens to us is when a great company gets into temporary trouble...We want to buy them when they're on the operating table.

41. Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble.”

42. The best chance to deploy capital is when things are going down.

43. It’s been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators are upbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance.

44. You’d get very rich if you thought of yourself as having a card with only twenty punches in a lifetime, and every financial decision used up one punch. You’d resist the temptation to dabble. You’d make more good decisions and you’d make more big decisions.

45. American business — and consequently a basket of stocks — is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead

46. We always live in an uncertain world. What is certain is that the United States will go forward over time.

47. For 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start.

48. You've got to understand accounting. It's got to be like a language to you

49. If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.

50. Your best investment is yourself. The more you learn, the more you'll earn

51. If you buy things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need.

52. Money saved is money that can be invested to grow over time

53. In the world of business, the people who are most successful are those who are doing what they love

54. It's better to hang out with people better than you. Pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours and you'll drift in that direction.

 55. I believe in giving my kids enough so they can do anything, but not so much that they can do nothing",2022-11-26 02:57:21
Almost everything is 10-20% off from credit card offers / perks program starting Q3.,2,z4q6a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z4q6a1/almost_everything_is_1020_off_from_credit_card/,3,1669415192.0,"I’ve noticed that since the beginning of this year, especially going into Q3 and Q4 that my Amex, Chase credit card all start to offer really aggressive discount on all spending categories. This is not a Black Friday or special holiday theme (though they are even more aggressive like the recent 50% off Amex perk on Amazon), but I see 20% cash back coupon regularly on FarFetch, Nordstrom, 10-20% on Dell, GoPro, Dyson and 25% on major hotel and dining chains for travel. 

My Citi thank you portal as of right now is offering 15% off on Apple Giftcard. It got to a point that you almost can’t find anything that’s not at least 10% off at any given time when you want to buy something, regardless if it is clothing, food, electronics and travel. But it also leaves a new habit of me where I won’t buy anything immediately until wait and see if I can find a 10-20% coupon or sale somewhere. So on one hand it is stimulating consumption, on the other it is creating the expectation of cheaper price - curbing consumption.

But the original motivation of retailers and credit card companies seem to be simple - is that this is a sign that people aren’t buying enough and companies need to throw an indirect way to stimulate consumption across the board without massively cutting their MSRP? Then why not just cut MSRP directly?",2022-11-26 00:26:32

# **Dow closes more than 150 points higher. Stocks notch gains for holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose Friday, notching a gain during the holiday-shortened trading week.
*****
> The Dow rose 152.97 points, or 0.45% to 34,347.03, marking the third consecutive session of gains. The S&P 500 fell 0.03% to end the day at 4,026.12. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.52% to 11,226.36, weighed down by shares of Activision Blizzard, which fell 4% on news that the FTC could block Microsoft from taking over the gaming company.
*****
> All three indexes ended the week higher. The Dow is up 1.78%, and the S&P 500 is up 1.53% during the short week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is lagging the other two indexes but is still up 0.72% in the same timeframe.
*****
> Stocks were muted at the start of the week as traders waited for minutes from the Federal Reserve’s November meeting. The minutes showed that the central bank anticipates slowing the pace of interest rate hikes going forward, which gave stocks a boost into the end of the week even amid choppy sessions due to low trading volumes.
*****
> “A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,” the minutes stated.
*****
> A slew of solid retail earnings reports signaling some consumer strength even amid worries of economic weakness also lifted stocks.
*****
> Worries about continued lockdowns in China kept markets in check. The country is ramping up Covid restrictions after seeing climbing case counts in recent days. Earlier in the week, China reported its first Covid deaths since May.
*****
> Next week, investors will be watching for more earnings reports from companies such as Kroger and Ulta Beauty on deck. On the economic front, traders will be watching further comments from Fed officials, as well as the release of the personal consumption expenditure report on Thursday — the central bank’s preferred inflation indicator. The November jobs print is due Friday.

> # Tempered Yearend Gains When S&P Down YTD Thanksgiving

> Last year at this time on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving S&P 500 was up 24.9% year-to-date. November 2021 gave back a fractional loss, but December and the Santa Claus Rally delivered solid gains.

> But then the stuff hit the fan. Inflation became non-transitory, the Fed began tapering asset purchases and telegraphing imminent rate hikes, Russia invaded Ukraine and the bear came out of hibernation.

> This year on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving the market is in an entirely different situation with S&P down -16.0% YTD. The table here shows how the market claws its way back in most years with fewer but sizable losses bringing the averages down.

> The fact that November 2022 is up so far is supportive for continued upside. What stands out to us in this table is the rather solid performance for the Tuesday before Thanksgiving-Santa Claus Rally trade as well as solid gains for the Santa Claus Rally itself.

> We wish everyone a happy and festive Thanksgiving and hope that you all enjoy the time with friends and family!

> # Continuing Claims Flash Recessionary Warning

> Due to tomorrow's holiday, this week's jobless claims data was released a day early and were not exactly a release to be thankful for. The latest readings were bad all around with both initial and continuing claims rising more than expected. For initial claims, last week's level was revised up by 1K to 222K, and this week's reading rose by 18K to 240K. That is the highest level of claims since the week of August 18th, and the sequential increase was the largest since the end of September. Whereas recent readings on jobless claims have been healthy in the sense that they have remained within the range of low readings from the few years prior to the pandemic, this new high would have been at the high end of the 2008 to 2019 pre-pandemic range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112322-Claims.png))**

> On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, the current week of the year typically sees claims move higher with a week-over-week increase 82% of the time. However, this week's increase was around 10K larger than what the comparable week of the year has historically averaged. In other words, from a seasonal perspective, the rise in claims is perfectly normal in terms of direction but less so in terms of size. Now at 248K, claims are in line with levels for the comparable weeks in 2021 and 2019.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112322-Claims-NSA.png))**

> Continuing claims continue to be the more interesting story around jobless claims. Delayed one week to the initial claims number, continuing claims as of the week of November 11th rose for a sixth week in a row. As we noted last week, such a streak of consistent increases in continuing claims has been rare, especially in the years following the Global Financial Crisis. In fact, the rise during the onset of the pandemic in 2020—which lasted for 10 consecutive weeks—was the only other notably lengthy streak post-2009. Prior to that, there have only been a handful of other times in which continuing claims have risen for 10 weeks or more.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112322-Con-Claims-Streak.png))**

> As for the current rise in claims, the latest increase leaves the reading at 1.551 million which is the highest level since the first week of March. From a historical perspective, though, that remains an impressively low reading and well below the pre-pandemic range even if it is rapidly deteriorating.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112322-Con-Claims.png))**

> As for just how bad of a stretch it has been for continuing claims, the 187K increase, or 13.7% jump, during the past six weeks would be by far the largest in over a decade outside of the start of the pandemic. Additionally, such a large increase in the span of six weeks is consistent with increases from all prior recessions. In fact, as claims have made their way off of historic lows, the current increase is nearly the same size as the early 1990s recession and is even larger than those in the early 1980s and early 2000s.

> # Speculators Smelting Shorts

> As we do each Monday, in last night's Closer we recapped the latest Commitments of Traders data from the CFTC. This data set provides a look at how speculators have positioned themselves (long or short) in various futures. We show those readings as a net percentage of open interest. In other words, higher positive values indicate a much larger share of open interest is positioned long and vice versa for negative readings.

> In the commodities space, after longs backed out in a big way earlier this year, readings have risen rapidly in gold, silver, copper, and palladium futures. As for how sharp of turnarounds they have been, the increase over the past two weeks rank in the top decile of all periods in data going back to the mid 1980s for each of the previously mentioned metals.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112222-COT-1.png))**

> For the most widely followed of these metals (gold, silver, and copper), this is only the 14th time on record each of their two week changes ranked in the 90th percentile or above in the same week without another occurrence in the prior three months. The most recent occurrence of such a large broad increase in major metals positioning was in July of 2014.

> Although these readings indicate that speculators are increasingly placing long bets on these futures, such data actually can be a bit of a messy indicator for forward performance. Although these readings indicate bullish sentiment, forward performance is the opposite in the near term with dramatic underperformance relative to the norm one week later (which we have seen play out so far). One month and three month performance tends to see further declines in these commodities as well which is not exactly unheard of for precious metals while it is dramatically weaker for the industrial metals. Six month performance is generally more in line with historical norms while the bullishness in positioning only seems to come through to price action one year out. One year average returns for gold, silver, and copper are much stronger than the norm, although positivity rates are still just barely above 50/50. (Past performance is no guarantee of future results.).

> # The “Most Obvious” Bear Market Rally Ever?


> “ The stock market is never obvious. It is designed to fool most of the people, most of the time.” Jesse Livermore

> I’ve noticed a trend the past few weeks and that is since the mid-October lows most commentators say we are obviously experiencing a bear market rally in stocks. But is it really so obvious? Remember, as one of the greatest traders ever said, the market’s job is to fool the masses most of the time. Wouldn’t it be something if this was actually the start of a new bullish phase and not just another bear market bounce?

> # What’s a Bear Market?
First things first, what is a bear market rally? To me, it is when stocks bounce (potentially significantly), only to eventually move back to new lows. Think about the 17% rally the S&P 500 saw over the summer, only to roll back over and make new lows in October. That’s a bear market rally, which is what most think is happening now.

> # Calling This a Bear Market Rally Is Popular
Here’s the catch, most stocks actually bottomed back in June. That’s right, more 52-week lows took place in June than in October, so you could say we’ve been in a new bull market for five full months now. Not a popular take I’m aware, but one that could be happening. Not to mention small caps didn’t break their June lows back in October. Remember, there are a lot more small caps than there are large caps, again suggesting the real lows took place in June, not October.

> Here’s a very quick Google search of ‘bear market rally’ and you can get a taste for what I mean about most thinking this is nothing more than a bear market rally.

> I do a lot of social media, specifically Twitter, and I must say that the amount of anger when stocks go higher is about as high as I can ever remember. Bullish tweets or stats are simply crushed by an angry mob. Given this is a family website, I can’t share some of the comments, but let’s just say being remotely bullish is frowned upon by most investors and traders right now. Again, this is likely because some people believe it is so ‘obvious’ to everyone this is only a bear market rally, and new lows are a near certain but maybe it isn’t so obvious.

> # More Signs the Crowd Isn’t In a Good Mood
The great Stoic philosopher, Seneca the Younger said, “We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.” One might interpret that as we all worry too much and things really aren’t as bad as they seem. And this could be what is happening right now. We keep hearing how bad the economy is, yet as Sonu noted last week, the consumer is quite strong. In fact, the fourth quarter is expected to see GDP growth of more than 3% according to the Atlanta Fed. Speaking of Seneca the Younger, do you know who his father was? Seneca the Elder. I’m serious, that was his name. Gotta love Ancient Rome and its philosophers!

> Enough Ancient Roman jokes and back to why this likely isn’t just a bear market rally, and why it could be the start to a new bullish move higher. One of my favorite surveys is the Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey. This monthly survey asks real money managers what they expect and how they are positioned. The recent report showed cash was up 6.2% of a portfolio, near the highest level since 2001, while a net 77% of respondents expected a global recession within 12 months.

> But my favorite stat was “0% were looking for a ‘goldilocks’ scenario.” Take note, this scenario would mean above-trend growth and below-trend inflation (See BofA Global Fund Manager Survey chart below). I agree it would be quite hard to expect that right here and now, but my takeaway is nearly no one is expecting good things to happen. Meaning expectations are historically low. As the chart below shows (focus on the yellow line), the last time it was this low was in late 2011, when all we heard about was the fiscal cliff drama out of Washington. Looking back, 2012, 2013, and 2014 were very solid years for both the economy and great years for the stock market. Given expectations got so low back then, good news then sparked a much better stock market and we think a similar situation could be in play again as we head into 2023.

> George Orwell said, “To see what is in front of one’s nose is a constant struggle.” That is what is happening now, in my opinion. Things are getting better, yet people are focusing on the past and for some reason, angry about good news. My take is don’t be angry and embrace what could be better times and better news coming.

> I hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving week and you all enjoy eating way too much food with family and friends!

> # Time to Feast Thanksgiving-Santa Claus Rally Trade

> Market action this past week and today has set up this annual market feast. Stocks have consolidated October’s big gains in typical early-November fashion setting the market up for the perennial yearend rally.

> Since 1950 S&P 500 is up 80% of the time from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to the 2nd trading day of the year, average gain 2.7%. Russell 2000 is up 79% of the time since 1979, average gain 3.4%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/296d2cdf14bf31f7acd66709ed72f8b6/4b3944852faa5d0b-54/s500x750/245e708ac6a7b175a622927710ec92d2460f8b0e.jpg))**

> Thanksgiving kicks off a run of solid bullish seasonal patterns. November-January is the year’s best consecutive 3-month span (2023 STA p 149) and as we have been discussing all year we are at the outset of the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Cycle (2023 STA p 34). Then there’s the January Effect (2023 STA pgs 112 & 114) of small caps outperforming large caps in January, which nowadays begins in mid-December.

> And of course, the “Santa Claus Rally,” (2023 STA p 118) invented and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 in the Almanac and often misunderstood, is the short, sweet rally that runs from the last 5 trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. Pop also coined the phrase: “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

> So, we have combined these seasonal occurrences into one trade: Buy the Tuesday before Thanksgiving and hold until the 2nd trading day of the New Year. Our good friend and renowned technician and options guru Larry McMillan of the Options Strategist opened our eyes to this trade and runs it with options on iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) starting on the day before Thanksgiving.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Looking at so many mega caps and airlines that spent billions in buybacks in 2021. It actually hurts to think about how much they spent and how that money is up in smoke.  Why not wait until a “dip” to buy instead of buying at all time highs?

Riddle me this.

On September 21, the Fed released its new economic projections. They raised the rate an expected 0.75%, but what really shook the market was the increased terminal rate projections for 2022 - 2024 (but the long-term rate projection stayed at 2.5%). The new (increased) projections for the overnight Fed Funds rate were for 4.4% by end of 2022, and 4.6% for 2023. 

The market bottoms September 30.

Then, on November 23, the ""minutes"" from the November meeting are released. It supports what individual Fed member have said over the last few weeks, which is a higher terminal rate than last projected, likely over 5.0% in 2023, which obviously would require a slowing of rate increases since we will be at 4.5% within a few weeks.

And the market moons and there was much rejoicing.

Disney rumors,0,z3v3io,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z3v3io/disney_rumors/,61,1669325272.0,"There are Rumors since Bob Iger cameback that Disney will get bought out.  I have mentioned that a possibility of some kind of merger would probably happen. I just didn't guess it would be apple.  I primarily said this because Disney just has too much debt. 90 Billion is estimated in debt.  I generally think this is a kick the can down the road further until someone in the future has to deal with the debt. 

 The company is worth an estimated 98 billion when you subtract  all of debt & liabilities from the assets. But even that number is misleading. When you subtract the hair brain scheme known as IP from the assets because IPs are just noting but glorified IOUs and perception brand name it's less. Disney is worth -50 billion in the hole.

In the last 6 months the Dow Jones is up over 7%, the S&P is up 1,35% and the Nasdaq is down 2%. All this amid one of the fastest interest rates increase in the last century, trade war with China and lockdowns, war in Ukraine, energy crisis, quantitative tightening, crypto crash, inflation crisis and strong dollar that caused headwinds for almost all companies. If all that didn't tank the market in the last 6 months, nothing will. If you think a mild recession in the US will cause the stock market to drop hugely from this level you're delusional because we already know a recession will happen and it will be counterbalanced by the FED pausing the hiking of interest rates and maybe China reopening.

We're seeing that the job market is still strong and as long as people are getting paid and have a job the demand won't collapse. The job market will cool a bit, enough to reduce inflation but we won't have massive layoffs...only some companies in the tech industry saw some big layoffs but that's because they hired way too much in the first place when the times were good. 

Energy and commodities prices are also down a lot and that was the biggest contributor to inflation, the CPI will decline every month and in 2023 it will be helped by favorable comps with last (this) year.

From now until the next quarter results I see nothing going on for the bears. The next big announcement will be the CPI in December and it will be favorable given how energy prices have collapsed. Then the FED in December will hike either 50bps or 25bps and the market will cheer by the slowing down on the increases.

"Tesla regains the ""hearts and minds"" of Big Morgan and Citi after plunging more than 50%.",203,z3bp4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z3bp4r/tesla_regains_the_hearts_and_minds_of_big_morgan/,224,1669268824.0,"Tesla (Tesla Inc.) market value in two months evaporated nearly $ 300 billion, but now, a growing number of Wall Street analysts have begun to say that the company's shares have fallen enough to advise investors not to miss this round of buying opportunities.

&#x200B;

As of Wednesday's U.S. stock close, Tesla was trading at $183.20, up nearly 8 percent, the biggest one-day gain since July.

&#x200B;

Morgan Stanley (Morgan Stanley) analyst Adam Jonas said earlier that Tesla is approaching his ""bear market target price"" of $ 150, which provides investors with the opportunity to buy at a lower price. Citi analysts also raised the stock's rating to neutral from sell, saying the stock's more than 50 percent decline this year ""offsets short-term risk/reward.

&#x200B;

Jonas wrote in a report that Tesla is the only electric car maker in Morgan Stanley's survey that is profitable through car sales, despite challenges such as slowing demand and price cuts in China.

&#x200B;

The analyst reiterated his $330 price target. He also highlighted the potential for Tesla to benefit from consumer tax credits in the United States.

&#x200B;

No coincidence. Citi analyst Itay Michaeli also upgraded the stock on Wednesday, giving him a $176 price target, one of the lowest on Wall Street. The analyst said he has become more optimistic because Tesla's plunge means some of the stock's overly optimistic expectations have now been repriced.

&#x200B;

Tesla's shares have plunged this year due to rising raw material costs, production and sales problems and customer budget pressures. Recent distractions from the company's CEO Musk, who is focused on turning around Twitter, have also dampened market sentiment.

&#x200B;

Jonas said that to stop the decline in the stock price, it is necessary to end the disruption caused by Twitter. He wrote, ""There has to be some form of sentiment 'meltdown mechanism' around the tweets to calm investor concerns about Tesla.""

&#x200B;

Despite all the challenges Tesla has faced this year, Wall Street has remained largely optimistic. Most Tesla analysts have a Buy or Neutral rating on the stock, although the stock is currently 57 percent away from the average analyst target price.

&#x200B;

In addition, Tesla's plunge this year has reduced the stock's expected price-to-earnings ratio from more than 200 times in early 2021 to 31 times now.",2022-11-24 07:47:04

The revenues are up more than 100% over the last decade and were increasing in 7/10 years. 

The gross margin remains stable at around 40% while the operating margin slightly improved from 12 to 13%.

Operating income for LTM - **$351m**

Net debt remains fairly stable around **$900m**

Market cap - **$1.64b**

Hence -->EV is around **$2.5b**

P/E is around **8**

In the meantime, the share price has been quite volatile and now is at a very, very low point historically. I cannot tie the numbers to the share price movement as the fundamentals remain stable and strong throughout the entire decade.

It could be that it is trading cheap only because it is in LATAM and there's always political as well as inflation risk.

"Fed officials see smaller rate hikes coming ‘soon,’ minutes show",1098,z2xhh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z2xhh7/fed_officials_see_smaller_rate_hikes_coming_soon/,236,1669230191.0,"Federal Reserve officials earlier this month agreed that smaller interest rate increases should happen soon as they evaluate the impact policy is having on the economy, meeting minutes released Wednesday indicated.

Reflecting statements that multiple officials have made over the past several weeks, the meeting summary pointed to small rate hikes are coming. Markets widely expect the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to step down to a 0.5 percentage point increase in December, following four straight 0.75 percentage point hikes.

Though hinting that smaller moves were ahead, officials said they still see little signs of inflation abating. However, some committee members expressed concern about risks to the financial system should the Fed continue to press forward at the same aggressive pace.

“A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,” the minutes stated. “The uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited regarding why such an assessment was important.“

The minutes noted that the smaller hikes would give policymakers a chance to evaluate the impact of the succession of rate hikes.

The summary noted that a few members indicated that “slowing the pace of increase could reduce the risk of instability in the financial system.” Others said they’d like to wait to ease up on the pace. Officials said they see the balance of risks on the economy now skewed to the downside.

Markets had been looking for clues about not only what the next rate hike might look like but also for how far policymakers think they’ll have to go next year to make satisfactory progress against inflation.

Officials at the meeting said it was just as important for the public to focus more on how far the Fed will go with rates “and the evolution of the policy stance thereafter, had become more important considerations for achieving the Committee’s goals than the pace of further increases in the target range.“

In recent days, officials have spoken largely in unison about the need to keep up the inflation fight, while also indicating they can pull back on the level of rate hikes. That means a strong likelihood of a 0.5 percentage point increase in December, but still an uncertain course after that.

Markets expect a few more rate hikes in 2023, taking the funds rate to around 5%, and then possibly some reductions before year end.

The post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee added a sentence that markets interpreted as a signal that the Fed will be doing smaller increases ahead. That sentence read, “In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“

Investors saw it as a nod to a reduced intensity of hikes following four straight 0.75 percentage point increases that took the Fed’s benchmark borrowing overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75-4%, the highest in 14 years.

Several Fed officials have said in recent days that they anticipate a likely half-point move in December.

“They’re getting to a point where they don’t have to move so quickly. That’s helpful since they don’t know exactly how much tightening they’re going to have to do,” said Bill English, a former Fed official now with the Yale School of Management. “They emphasize policy works with lags, so it’s helpful to be able to go a little bit more slowly.“

Inflation data lately has been showing some encouraging signs while remaining well above the central bank’s 2% official target.

The consumer price index in October was up 7.7% from a year ago, the lowest reading since January. However, a measure the Fed follows more closely, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, showed a 5.1% annual rise in September, up 0.2 percentage points from August and the highest reading since March.

Those reports came out after the November Fed meeting. Several officials said they viewed the reports positively but will need to see more before they consider easing up on policy tightening.

The Fed has been the target lately of some criticism that it could be tightening too much. The worry is that policymakers are too focused on backward-looking data and missing signs that inflation is ebbing and growth is slowing.

However, English expects the Fed officials to keep their collective foot on the break until there are clearer signals that prices are falling. He added that the Fed is willing to risk a slowing economy as it pursues its goal.

“They have risks in both directions if doing too little and doing too much. They’ve been fairly clear that they view the risks of inflation getting out of the box and the need to do a really big tightening as the biggest risk,” he said “It’s a hard time to be Jay Powell.”

There has also been a lot of discussion on if we're in a recession currently, or if we have yet to see the real recession. 

Bulls say we haven't seen unemployment rise significantly, so we can't be in a recession regardless of the 2 negative Q's we saw in the first half. Bears say we are about to go into a recession (if we aren't already) and employment is always lagging.

This got me thinking, there are only 2 ways to look at this market from here:

1. The recession started at the beginning of the year, and we were in it until end of Q2 basically. This would line up with the fact that the market bled out all year to price in the 2 negative quarters we had. Q3 GDP was positive, and Q4 Atlanta Fed GDP forecast is showing growth again, so stocks have bottomed.
2. We are not and have not been in a recession this year. The entire down move in the market over the last \~10-11 months was multiple compression, and next year we see the impact of rate increases on the economy, and that's when we get a real earnings contraction + higher unemployment.

* Inflation looks to have peaked (look at CPI)
* Short-term interest rates also may have peaked (look at two-year Treasury yield)
* 10-year yield peaked (recently dropped to around 3.7%)

**Risk for more volatility** as earnings have not hit bottom. But the stock market historically hits the bottom 3-6 months before earnings estimates bottom. Falling profit projections likely include falling 10-year yield would support—or even boost—earnings multiples.

>For starters, the S&P 500 is down 17% from its all-time high of 4796 hit in early January. It was down as much as 25% to its lowest close of the year of 3577, hit in early October. One key driver was that the Federal Reserve has been ratcheting interest rates higher in order to combat high inflation by reducing economic demand. That’s even after the inflation had already begun denting consumer demand. Plus, faster-growing technology companies have seen their valuations, or their stocks’ multiples of expected earnings, take a hit partly because higher rates make future profits less valuable. Those companies are expecting a bulk of their profits to come many years in the future.  
>  
>The thesis that the market has already bottomed hinges on the idea that inflation looks to have already peaked. The Consumer Price Index for October gained 7.7% year over year, down from 9.1% in June. Some of that is because higher prices, themselves, have caused consumers to turn away from shopping; retail companies have too much inventory and have had to mark prices down because demand isn’t strong enough for the supply. Plus, interest rates have already risen, though higher rates have more work to do in reducing inflation to the Fed’s 2% target.  
>  
>That inflation has peaked could mean short-term interest rates have also peaked. The federal-funds futures market is reflecting that the pace of rate hikes will slow down, before the Fed ultimately cuts rates in 2023. The two-year Treasury yield, a barometer for expectations about the fed-funds rate, is around 4.5%, below its multiyear peak of just over 4.7%. The assumption is that inflation and demand will be somewhat curbed by that point, so there’s a visible end to the Fed’s demand destruction. That would ultimately provide relief for the stock market.   
>  
>To that point, “if the economy manages to avoid recession or experiences only a modest contraction, a new bull market may already be unfolding,” wrote Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group.   
>  
>A peak in short-term rates could also mean the 10-year yield, a key component to stock-market forecasts, has also peaked. Higher short-term rates have played a role in pushing the 10-year yield higher this year, but recently, the 10-year yield has dropped to around 3.7% from a multiyear peak of just over 4.2%. That’s partially because higher short-term rates should ultimately reduce demand and long-term inflation, lowering the yield on the long-dated bond. That’s key for stocks because a lower yield on 10-year government debt increases the value of future profits, boosting equity valuations.  
>  
>All of these indicators, though, do point to weakening economic demand. Earnings forecasts might have to decline in the next few quarters. Wall Street hasn’t cut earnings estimates for 2023 as much as they have historically by the end of a calendar year. And this isn’t a normal year; earnings pressure could be worse, given the risk of a recession.   
>  
>But the stock market would likely resume rising before actual earnings results hit bottom. The stock market historically tends to hit bottom three to six months before earnings estimates bottom, according to RBC data. To be sure, if profit forecast drop enough, stocks would find a new bottom. But if earnings expectations drop even by 11% from here, and the S&P 500 doesn’t fall as much, the index would remain above its low for the year.   
>  
>Plus, an environment with profit projections falling likely includes falling bond yields. If company earnings—and stocks—are declining, then investors could rush into safe 10-year government bonds, the interest payments of which are guaranteed. That would bring the 10-year bond’s price up, and yield down. The yield is attractive anyway, as it’s well above average annual inflation expectations for the next decade of 2.31%. In this scenario, a falling 10-year yield would support—or even boost—earnings multiples even while earnings projections are dropping.   
>  
>If it sounds like stock market volatility is in store overall, that’s because it is. The S&P 500 could even revisit its low for the year. ",2022-11-23 19:20:02

TSLA to bounce from 2-year lows?,0,z2jzbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z2jzbv/tsla_to_bounce_from_2year_lows/,64,1669193217.0,"Vehicle recalls, lockdowns in China, Elon Musk's acquisition and involvement in Twitter- a number of factors have contributed to the selling pressure Tesla has faced in recent weeks. But with the stock having fallen for 8 of the last 10 weeks and now trading at 2-year lows, is all the negative news is priced in? 

Despite briefly dipping below, TSLA did close above support coming from the August 2020 highs at 167.50. This level may have added significance from a technical standpoint, as the breakout in November 2020 is what took the stock into ""new-high"" territory. Buyers may therefore eye this level as a good area for accumulation which could help the stock form a base, or even begin a rebound if longer-term investors also look to add to their positions. 

Of course, all trading carries risk, and TSLA could continue to struggle as the fundamental backdrop for the company, as well as the broader market, remain relatively bearish.",2022-11-23 10:46:57

* **The company reported weakness in commercial and consumer PC sales during the quarter that ended Oct. 31.**
* **HP also issued light earnings guidance for the new 2023 fiscal year.**

Computer maker HP Inc. said Tuesday that it plans to cut 4,000 to 6,000 employees over the next three years. Shares rose as much as 1% in extended trading following the announcement.

HP is the latest technology company to announce its intent to slim down given economic challenges. Facebook parent Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce are among those that have made similar changes. HP is responding after a deterioration in the sales of computers, which followed brought on by the Covid pandemic, where people rushed to buy computers to work and play from their homes.

In a statement, HP said it expects the changes to result in annualized gross run rate savings of at least $1.4 billion in the next three years, with around $1 billion in costs including restructuring. Of that $1 billion, $600 million will come in the fiscal 2023 fiscal year, which ends Oct. 31, 2023. The rest will be split evenly between the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years, HP said.

As of October 2021, HP had around 51,000 employees. In 2019 HP announced that it would eliminate between 7,000 and 9,000 employees.

HP said revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, declined 0.8% year over year to $14.80 billion. Revenue in the Personal Systems segment, which includes PCs, fell 13% to $10.3 billion, as units dropped 21%. Consumer revenue in the segment slid 25%. Printing revenue, at $4.5 billion, was down 7%, as units fell 3%.

In the previous quarter, Personal Systems revenue declined 3%, and Printing revenue moved down 6%.

Also on Tuesday HP announced downbeat earnings guidance.

The company provided a range of adjusted fiscal first quarter earnings from 70 cents to 80 cents per share, below the consensus of 86 cents among analysts polled by Refinitiv.

For the 2023 fiscal year, HP called for $3.20 to $3.60 in adjusted earnings per share, below the Refinitiv consensus of $3.62 per share.

Me, I’ve held BP since 2008. I averaged down during Deepwater Horizon but from first entry it’s about 30% down (excluding dividends, which are significant). 

Also held AstraZeneca since 2016, which is up about 110% (also ex div). Sold some though. A mistake but I probably needed the funds (which is the point, life happens and gets in the way of your “hold forever” intentions).",2022-11-22 21:16:57

Jim Cramer (love him or hate him), said that he made 20% a month when he ran his hedge fund.  

Let's say a trader has $100,000 in capital. He decides to swing trade 5 stocks. He divides his $100,000 into 5 and buys $20,000 worth of each stock (excluding commissions). He has a great month and makes 5% profit per stock in one month. 

What's his monthly ROI?  Is it 25%? Or is it 5%? 

Making 5% on $20,000 (x5 stocks) is the same as making 5% on $100,000.

Best Buy shares rise 10% as retailer sticks with its holiday-quarter outlook,218,z1x8re,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z1x8re/best_buy_shares_rise_10_as_retailer_sticks_with/,39,1669132851.0,"* **Best Buy reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street’s expectations.**
* **The retailer stuck to its holiday-quarter outlook as electronics demand held up.**
* **Comparable sales fell by less than Best Buy’s own projections.**

Best Buy on Tuesday surpassed Wall Street’s expectations for quarterly earnings, as inflation-dented demand for pricey consumer electronics came in better than feared.

The consumer electronics retailer, which had cut its forecast this summer, reiterated its outlook for the holiday quarter. It raised its full-year forecast to reflect the beat, saying it expects comparable sales to decline about 10%.

Shares of the company rose more than 10% on Tuesday. The stock is trading around $78 after hitting a 52-week low of $60.78 in October.

Here’s how the retailer did for the three-month period ended Oct. 29 compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, according to a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

* **Earnings per share**: $1.38 adjusted vs. $1.03 expected
* **Revenue**: $10.59 billion vs. $10.31 billion expected

While Best Buy’s quarterly results were better than expected, demand is down from the heights of the pandemic, when consumers turned to its stores for home theaters, computer monitors, kitchen appliances and more while working, playing and cooking at home.

Net sales for the fiscal third quarter declined by about 11% from $11.91 billion year over year in the third quarter. Net income fell to $277 million, or $1.22 per share, from $499 million, or $2 per share, a year earlier.

On a call with investors, CEO Corie Barry said sales declined across most of Best Buy’s product categories — with the largest decrease in computing and home theater. However, she said, compared to the same quarter in 2019, its computing revenue is 23% higher and its appliances revenue remains 37% higher.

Even as consumers paid more for groceries, gas and housing, she said the retailer “saw relatively consistent behavior from our purchasing customers.” But she added shoppers have a lot of interest in sales events.

“Across consumers we can also see that savings are being drawn down and credit usage is going up,” Barry said on the investor call. “And value clearly matters to everyone.”

Best Buy is staring down a more uncertain sales environment this holiday season. Some inflation-pinched consumers are pulling back on discretionary items and spending more money on necessities and experiences. The company joined other retailers in slashing its outlook this summer. It said at the time that it expects same-store sales to drop by about 11% for the 12-month period ending in January.

A month after Best Buy warned of slower sales, it cut jobs across the country.

Yet, so far, the company has topped its own expectations.

Comparable sales fell by 10.4%, less of a decline than the 12.9% that analysts expected, according to FactSet. The key metric, also called same-store sales, tracks sales online and at stores open at least 14 months.

It was also less of a drop than the retailer anticipated. Best Buy had not given specific guidance for comparable sales in the third-quarter, but its Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas had cautioned it would drop more than the 12.1% decline in the second quarter. 

The company said it has resumed share buybacks, which it paused when it took down its forecast in July. Best Buy said it plans to spend about $1 billion on share buybacks this year.

Best Buy, however, is still seeing inflation change shopping patterns. On a call with reporters, Barry said some lower-income consumers have opted for less-expensive TVs. On the other hand, she said, some wealthier consumers are picking premium products and trading up to laptops with more features when replacing them.

As the level of promotions picks up, CEO Barry said the company is tightly controlling its inventory, which was down 14.7% year over year. The retailer anticipated a decline in demand and lapped a year-ago period when shipments arrived both early and late because of a supply chain challenges.

Inventory has been a closely watched metric in the retail industry, as many companies cope with a glut of unwanted goods and have had to mark down items, cancel orders or pack and store goods.

Barry said on an investor call that holiday shopping patterns are also shifting to a more typical pre-pandemic pattern. She said the retailer expects customers to spend more during Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the two weeks leading up to Christmas.

Shares of Best Buy are down about 30% so far this year, underperforming the S&P 500 Index. Shares closed on Monday at $70.83, down nearly 2%. The company’s market value is $15.95 billion.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Uniper long DD,3,z1nwgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z1nwgu/uniper_long_dd/,17,1669103870.0,"Uniper is a German energy generation and trading company. 
It operates through 3 segments : European Generation, Global commodities,  and International Power generation. 
Basically, it buys and sells LNG to Germany, and other countries. 

The price per share used to be 40€. It tanked to 2.6€ at its lows. 

That's because it used to purchase the LNG from Russians. Who then decided to cut the pipeline supplying Germany (Nord Stream 2) 

Over the past week, however, there has been a **massive rally** from 4 to 7 € per share.
This is on the news that : 
1. Germany is ahead of schedule on their regasification project. 

The filling level of the natural gas storage facilities in Germany has cracked the 100 percent mark :

They are set to deliver 4.5 billion cubic meters of LNG per year, starting december first. 

This is why I'm very bullish even though the stock has jumped by more than 3fold from the past month. I see this going to 10, or even 12 when the terminal comes online and they are able to supply LNG to heat houses and power industries.",2022-11-22 09:57:50
Cathie Wood Goes On Coinbase Buying Spree as Wall Street Sours,709,z1ieuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z1ieuh/cathie_wood_goes_on_coinbase_buying_spree_as_wall/,373,1669085648.0,"Cathie Wood Goes On Coinbase Buying Spree as Wall Street Sours
Matt Turner, Bloomberg News

(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s waning conviction in Coinbase Global Inc. has done little to deter Cathie Wood. Instead, she’s been scooping up shares of the struggling cryptocurrency exchange in the wake of the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.

Wood’s Ark Investment Management funds have bought more than 1.3 million shares of Coinbase since the start of November, worth about $56 million based on Monday’s trading price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shopping spree, which started just as FTX’s demise began, has boosted Ark’s total holdings by roughly 19% to about 8.4 million shares. That equates to around 4.7% of Coinbase’s total outstanding shares.

Coinbase initially rebounded in the days following Ark’s first purchase on Nov. 8, due in large part to softer-than-expected US inflation data which sent risk-assets surging globally. That rally, however, was short-lived for the crypto exchange, with its stock price falling for four consecutive days, including an 8.9% drop on Monday to close at a fresh record low.

The majority of Ark’s Coinbase holdings are from its flagship ARK Innovation ETF which has nearly 6 million shares for a weighting of about 3.6%, the fund’s 13th largest position. While the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF each only hold just over 1 million shares, Coinbase’s weighting in the two funds is far higher at 5.4% and 6.3% respectively, according to data on Ark’s website.

Ark’s renewed interest in Coinbase stands in stark contrast to the sentiment emanating from Wall Street for the better part of the last six months. Analysts from firms including Bank of America and Daiwa Securities have downgraded the stock this month, leaving it with just 14 buy-equivalent analyst recommendations, its lowest number since August 2021.

Wood has also been adding to stakes in other crypto-related assets in recent weeks. Her ARK Next Generation Internet ETF purchased more than 315,000 shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust last week as its discount relative to the value of its underlying cryptocurrency continues to widen. That buying was followed later in the week by a purchase of about 140,000 shares of crypto bank Silvergate Capital Corp.

The increased buying comes as cryptocurrecy-exposed stocks have plunged this year amid a deep selloff by tokens including Bitcoin and Ether. Coinbase and Silvergate Capital have both shed more than 80% of their value this year. Those losses are even deeper than those suffered by the world’s two largest cryptocurrenices -- their prices have declined by more than 65% in 2022 with the plunge accelerating this month in the wake of the FTX collapse.

$DHR Danaher Corporation Due Diligence,4,z1elfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z1elfl/dhr_danaher_corporation_due_diligence/,6,1669075115.0," Hi Folks!

Credit for this rabbit hole I found myself going down goes to my brother-in-law Andre The Giant [u/Difficult\_Quality255](https://www.reddit.com/u/Difficult_Quality255/). White collar, white hat business analytics type. Thanksgiving dinners have been interesting since GME round 1. The following is his assessment. I'll add my contributions of fundamentals and TA/options at the bottom.

TLDR: Pantone will now require a subscription to use their color schemes in Adobe. Even for templates or images already made. $15/month for millions of users. Fundamentally, it leads it's industry=Bullish. TA = bullish. Analysts= Bullish. Way OTM call OI= Bullish. Tits=Jacked.

: Price Trajectory – Danaher

It has come to my attention that Danaher is about to experience growth in earnings. You may have heard about Pantone moving to a subscription model to use its colors in Adobe products. This means that for color matching requirements of print shops, they will have to purchase this subscription for each active user to meet customers’ demands. This affects more than just the print industry; housing designers and graphic artists will also be affected. It is important to note that the product already exists. They did not have to build digital color pallets, instead are now charging for a product that was initially free.

The number of adobe cloud service users is 21,000,000, according to Adobe, in 2021. The Subscription fee for Pantone is $15.00/month on top of the need to purchase new physical swatches as needed. We can assume that anywhere from 1%-80% of adobe users will require to purchase this subscription based on need or having images already built with Pantone’s colors. (For clarification, old images will not retain their colors and only be black and white. This is a forced update for adobe cloud users).

We could see anywhere from 260,000 subscriptions to 20,800,000 subscriptions. This will negligibly affect the COGS/Op Margin of Pantone’s Parent Company XRite/Danaher.

Total Adobe Cloud Customers 26000000

Customers Monthly Income Annual Income Percent of DHR Rev

1% Conversion 260,000 $3,900,000 $46,800,000 0.20%

80% Conversion 20800000 $312,000,000 $3,744,000,000 16.21%

Compared with the Direct Leverage Calculations below, we can see that a 16.21% change in Revenues will result in a 13.13% increase in EPS. This free revenue will also improve DHR’s ratios across the board depending on the actual conversion of the Pantone subscription. With enough of a push on calls and purchasing of stock, in combination with Danaher’s increased performance, I believe that the price will surge beyond $350.00.

Direct Leverage Calculations

2022 2021 Delta

Rev ($MM) 23102 21305 8.43%

EPS 6.76 6.33 6.79%

EBIT ($MM) 6234 5685 9.66%

    Results		 

DOL 1.14

DFL 0.70

DCL 0.81

Seems legit right? Moving forward with fundamentals and TA/Options

Fundamentals:

Company is a powerhouse without the incoming mass injection of cash from the color scheme going from free to subscription.

Revenue was 29.5 Billion in 2021, projected to increase by 4.4% for 2022 and 2023. The projection doesn't take into account the new subscription revenue.

Gross margin and operating cash yield has beat industry average 5 years in a row.

EPS beats 12 Qs in a row, all >2%.

All this while paying a dividend.

Technicals:

On the daily candles, it had a false breakout of its expanding triangle last week, and has consolidated near the top with a green spinner. Could see a new breakout attempt this week. 

Options: Interesting things happening on the call side with way OTM before, but especially after the new year. OI at 370 and 380 strikes really caught my eye.

📷

POS: Started small today with 5 Calls 370 Strike Mar 17, 2023(yes, the only 5 traded today). I intend on low balling my way to 50 calls by EOM. 250 by EOY.

Done trying to pick stocks.

in a communication issued from ZIM says the Q3 dividend will be $2.95 per share

and that the full year div will be $10.55 per share

So today's ZIM price is around $24.25, so

10.55 / 24.25 = 0.435    so 43.5 % is the actual dividend yield

The US Treasury Yield Curve Recession Indicator is Flashing Red,856,z17j6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z17j6u/the_us_treasury_yield_curve_recession_indicator/,203,1669058399.0,"From the article:


Even as stock investors cheer signs of inflation peaking, the bond market’s best-known predictor of recessions is showing its clearest signal yet that there is trouble ahead for the US economy.

It’s known in Wall Street lingo as an inverted yield curve, and in recent days it has moved to its most extreme levels since the 1982 recession thanks to a big drop in long-term bond yields. When this dynamic has been in place over the last two decades, in each case a recession has followed. (For a look at the history of yield curves and recessions, see our earlier story here.)

While an inverted US Treasury yield curve isn’t known as a predictor of how deep or how long a recession may last, or even when a recession will begin, market watchers say the current message is unmistakable.

""Historically, when you get a sustained inversion like this […] it’s a very reliable indicator of a recession coming,"" says Duane McAllister, a senior portfolio manager at US firm Baird Advisors.

That leaves many market observers saying the real question isn’t whether there will there be a recession, but what it will look like. Will it be shallow or deep? Short or drawn out?

Money managers and economists are wrestling with these questions. Many say the outlook is highly uncertain against a backdrop of recent economic data painting a somewhat conflicting picture. On the one hand, inflation has started to come down from 40-year highs, which should give the Federal Reserve the ability to slow the pace of interest-rate increases.

However, inflation remains extremely hot despite its recent easing. At the same time, job growth and consumer spending remain robust. In fact, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast, a running estimate of economic growth, is clocking in an extremely strong 4.2% rate of growth for the fourth quarter. Those indicators suggest the Fed can’t afford to stop raising rates too early and risk embedding higher inflation into the economy, analysts say.

$ALLY an interesting dividend play?,15,z15ew7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z15ew7/ally_an_interesting_dividend_play/,33,1669053581.0,"Ran a basic screen for stocks with a dividend yield over 4%, payout ratio under 50% (to judge the sustainability of current dividend and chance the dividend can rise) and the distance from the 52-week low <5%.

$ALLY jumps out from the list. 4.61% dividend yield, only a 10.70% payout ratio (lots of dividend safety, w room for increases), only 4.75% above the 52-week low. 

There are concerns about their reserves should a recession cause a lot of defaults. But it sure seems as if the market is pricing in a ton of downside. ALLY trades at a large discount to the big banks (a P/E under 5, and trading for less than book value)

Analyst targets (for what theyre worth) place the upside of the stock at more than 35%. According to BofA, their target actually is pricing in a recession.

 “We expect markets to transition into a ‘Hope’ phase of the next bull market at some point in 2023, but from a lower level,” said a team led by Goldman’s chief global strategist Peter Oppenheimer, in a note to clients. “The initial rebound from the trough is likely to be strong, in common with the beginning of most cycles before transitioning into a ‘Post Modern Cycle’ with lower returns.” 

 Catching the “hope” phase just right is indeed tricky. Their above chart shows how average returns overall in the following 12 months are much higher if an investor waits one month until after the trough as opposed to investing a month before.

Also during that phase, initial recovery trends tend to be led by assets that have underperformed the most during the bear market phase. “This is what makes these transitions so difficult to navigate — the recovery when it comes tends to be swift and led by the types of companies that investors tend to avoid through the bear market.”

“That said, this is ‘the trade after the trade’ and we think it is premature to be positioning for this now” said Goldman, urging investors to hold their horses.

As for right now, strategists are all in on a “barbell approach,” which means investing across the risk spectrum with the goal of getting a more even portfolio. Their mix consists of quality, strong balance sheet and stable margin companies, with deep value, energy and resources where valuation risks remain limited.

“We like companies that can compound earnings and returns through a combination of reinvestment and dividends over time,” he said, adding that in contrast to the last cycle, they want more diversification across styles and regions and more emphasis on valuation, which should “enhance returns through 2023.”

Clearly for him, this is a realistic scenario but not for almost everyone else - certainly those watching his comments for 'tips'.

Well my journey has come full circle in the past week with TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor). This was 1st on my radar earlier this year and some very quick research told me they were big, made 50% of global semiconductors and had been hit by the supply chain issues affecting much of the Asian market.

I decided I would buy in, but would be committed and go in for the long term and generally start focussing on fewer stocks. I 1st purchased on 2nd March at $108 and steadily increased my position most months. The result was, that despite the falling market and my initial holding being savaged, I was able to reduce my average price to $80.

Last week Warren Buffet bought $4 billion worth of shares and my position is now in positive territory.

I now realise how stupid it has been to buy in smaller positions stocks without being fully committed to a holding and to keep buying it.

# **S&P 500 closes higher on Friday, but ends week with losses - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
> The major averages ticked higher in afternoon trading Friday to end the day on an upbeat note as investors assessed tougher language from Federal Reserve speakers and pored over the latest earnings reports.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 199.37 points, or 0.59%, to 33,745.69, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.48% to 3,965.34. The Nasdaq Composite finished just 0.01% above the flat line at 11,146.06.
*****
> All of the major averages posted losses for the week. The Dow ended 0.01% lower. The S&P 500 lost 0.69% for the week, while the Nasdaq ended 1.57% lower. All three indexes are positive for the month, however.
*****
> The market was divided for much of the day, with the S&P 500 trading mostly flat as investors started to reset expectations after a couple of rallies over the past week, beginning with the October CPI print. Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, said this week is characterized by a “back-to-reality viewpoint.”
*****
> “Following the big rally coming off the better-than-expected CPI print, the market’s digesting the current data, which is bringing things back to reality,” she said. “The rally that followed the CPI print we don’t feel was justified by fundamentals… The market’s also pricing in a soft landing here, which we don’t think is likely to occur. So when you hear the Fed officials coming out and reiterating their stance, you’re starting to see the market readjust to that.”
*****
> On Friday, Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins expressed confidence that policymakers can tame inflation without doing too much damage to employment.
*****
> St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Thursday that “the policy rate is not yet in a zone that may be considered sufficiently restrictive.” He suggested that the appropriate zone for the federal funds rate could be in the 5% to 7% range, which is higher than what the market is pricing.
*****
> ""We continue to think investors should place much more emphasis on the actual data and not focus too much on Fed rhetoric (the former will show where inflation is headed while the latter is fixated on where it was),” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge. “That said, investors are tired of battling the Fed’s daily tape bombs and the fear is it may take 2-3 more CPIs for officials to stop admonishing the market every time it tries to rally.”

> # Do Stocks Really Like Gridlock?

> The midterm elections are over, and the results aren’t 100% official yet, but we do know that we’ll have a divided government. As of now, the Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate to maintain control there, while the Republicans gained their 218th seat in the House to take control there. The bottom line though is neither the Senate nor the House has large majorities, in fact, they are both near historically small margins.

> So that’s the big question, do stocks really like gridlock? Of course, things are never this simple, as there are so many other factors that matter to how stocks do, but it sure looks like gridlock could be a tailwind for stocks. Or at the very least, not a major headwind.

> Here’s a chart that shows all the times since 1950 we’ve had a divided government and how the S&P 500 did in those years. The average return for stocks was a very solid 15.7% under a divided government, with only one-year falling significantly back in 1981, while 2011 was nearly exactly breakeven. The other years saw some solid returns.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-176-800x297.png))**

> As of now, it is expected the Republicans will take a three-seat majority in the House (this could change, but it’ll likely be near this number). This would be the smallest majority for the Republicans since 3 seats in 2001 and 2002. Here’s a great chart that shows just how rare it is to have a majority this small. Fun stat, the House moved to 435 seats in 1913, meaning 218 seats gives a party the majority. Fun stat #2, the Democrats controlled the House from 1955 to 1994, but things have been more even over recent years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-2-800x357.png))**

> What exactly does a small-seat majority in the House mean? Odds are a small majority means there could be some gridlock, so do stocks like this? Below we show again this appears to be the case. When there is less than a 20-seat House majority, the S&P 500 gained a median of 19.5% and was higher 12 out of 15 times when looking at the first year of a new Congress. In fact, 9 of the past 10 times there was a new Congress and a small majority, stocks finished higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-3-800x485.png))**

> In conclusion, stocks really do appear to have no issues with a divided government and in many cases, stocks have done just fine under this scenario.

> The recent 21-year typical November graph here points to a seasonal cycle low point tomorrow, the 14th trading day of the month, the Friday before Thanksgiving and Op-Ex day. Thanksgiving week has a notorious “holiday fueled” bullish bias as do the last seven trading days of the month.

> However, as you can see from the tables here of the history of the Thanksgiving trade the bullish bias has weakened over the last several years. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness in the week or days before the holiday and selling any subsequent rally toward the end of Thanksgiving week or before month-end.

> First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&P 500 decline was in 1964. Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 35 years since 1987, there have been 10 declines and 25 advances. See 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac page 106 for more.

> # Highest Bullish Sentiment of the Year

> As we noted last week, this week's sentiment data is the first to encapsulate any reaction to last week's CPI number as well as the subsequent market rally. Although price action has been somewhat choppy and there have been plenty of other catalysts (FTX's collapse, more yield curve inversions, the missile strike in Poland) to balance out the inflation data and put investors back onto their heels, the latest AAII survey has shown a surge in bullish sentiment. The percentage of respondents reporting as optimistic jumped from 25.1% last week up to 33.5% this week. That is not only the largest one-week increase since the first week of June (when bulls rose by 12.2 percentage points) but is now the highest reading on bulls since the last week of 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-1.png))**

> Bearish sentiment in turn dropped sharply falling to 40.2% for a decline of 6.8 percentage points. While an improvement, at the start of the month bearish sentiment had fallen by much more (both the last week of October and the first week of November saw double-digit week-over-week declines) and was at a much lower level of 32.9%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-2.png))**

> The bull-bear spread has narrowed but still remains negative for the 33rd week in a row. If the spread remains negative into next week, it will tie the record streak from 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-3.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-6.png))**

> Neutral sentiment fell for a second week in a row with the total decline in that time eclipsing 10 percentage points. At 26.3%, it is down to the lowest level since the week of October 20th, implying that investors have become a bit more decisive in their respective market views.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-4.png))**

> The AAII survey's more bullish turn this week was also seen in other readings on sentiment like the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure Index. As a result, our sentiment composite which aggregates the findings of the three surveys into a single sentiment reading is back up to its highest reading since mid-August. Although the reading remains negative, it is no longer at the extreme levels that were common earlier this year.

> # Consumer Discretionary's Muddled Relative Strength

> Ranging from today's retail sales report to homebuilder sentiment to the earnings of some of the largest retailers like Target (TGT) and Lowe's (LOW), the economic and earnings calendar this week has given Consumer Discretionary stocks plenty of news to digest. Outside of the spring to late summer, the sector has generally been on the decline relative to the S&P 500 in 2022. Last week, that relative strength line bounced right as it reached the late May low. However, over the past few days, it has been resuming its move lower, meaning it is back to underperforming.

> While on a sector level the relative strength line has been falling, drilling down to the industry group level, there has been more variation. For example, even with some positive responses to earnings from the likes of Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW), the retailing industry has seen a sharp grind lower in its relative strength line versus the S&P 500. Similarly, autos have seen a turn lower although it has been underperforming the S&P for a longer period of time since the early fall. Meanwhile, Consumer Durables and Appliances (which includes stocks like the homebuilders and home appliance makers) has been moving higher. That move has paled in comparison to the relative strength of Consumer Services stocks (restaurants, cruise lines, hotels and resorts), though, as that group's line has surged over the past couple of months.

> As mentioned above, retailers in the Consumer Discretionary sector have been underperforming the S&P 500 lately but there is another group of retailers in which performance has been more solid. The Food & Staples Retail industry is a component of the Consumer Staples sector, and its relative strength line has been trending higher since the spring lows. In fact, after the past week's move higher thanks in part to a strong response to Walmart (WMT) earnings, its relative strength line is approaching some of the highest levels of the past year, entirely recovering the massive drop from May in the wake of another, much more negatively received, WMT earnings report.

> # How Bottoms Form. (It Might Surprise You.)

> The S&P 500 rallied again last week and was more than 10% off the October 12 closing lows, before selling off some yesterday. Nonetheless, the truth is the overall news really hasn’t really been that great, yet stocks have staged a strong rally over the past month. What gives?

> Turns out, this is what tends to happen coming off major lows for stocks more often than not. Our friends at JPM Asset Management put together some of the best charts I’ve ever seen to describe this phenomenon. You can read the whole report from Michael Cembalest here.

> They found that from the Eisenhower recession in 1957 to stagflation in the 1970s, to the early 1980s double dip recession, to the 1990 recession, stocks turned higher well before the other parts of the economy began to turn higher. As you can see below, stocks tended to bottom months (and sometimes years) before earnings, GDP, and payrolls officially turn higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-166-800x527.png))**

> More recently we saw similar action during the Financial Crisis and then again during the worst of COVID. I’ll never forget how stocks soared in April, May, and June of 2020, yet we saw some of the very worst headlines in our country’s history. The truth is the stock market isn’t looking in the rear-view mirror, it is always looking forward and discounting what could be out there in the future.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-245-800x257.png))**

> To keep things honest, this doesn’t have a perfect track record, as, after the dot-com burst, GDP and earnings both turned higher well before stocks officially bottomed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-34.png))**

> This in one of the more confusing concepts for many investors, but it is one that is so important to understand. Stocks will likely rise even as the news is bad, this is how it works. If you are waiting for things to officially improve, you likely will miss out on substantial gains along the way.

> Burt White likes to say if you are playing a video game and you are going toward the monsters, you are going in the right direction. Investing is similar, as times will sometimes be extra scary, but this is part of the process. If you are scared or uncomfortable, that is all part of investing in a lot of ways and if you run the other way every time things get scary, you’ll likely never be able to meet your investment goals.

> # Homebuilder Hopes Demolished

> The national average on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has come back below 7%, but it remains elevated versus recent history as housing data still can't catch a break. This morning, the NAHB released their latest reading on homebuilder sentiment and for the eleventh month in a row, the headline index fell month over month. As shown below, the current streak of nearly a year straight of declines is far and away a record, surpassing two eight-month long streaks leading up to the Financial Crisis.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-1a.png))**

> This month, homebuilder sentiment dropped another 5 points down to 33. That is not the largest drop of the current streak of declines, with bigger drops of 8 points last month or 12 points in July, but it still ranks in the bottom 4% of all months on record. In other words, not only is homebuilder sentiment falling consistently, but it's falling fairly fast. The other components have also seen bottom decile declines with the only sub-index avoiding declines being in the West.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-2.png))**

> After the November decline, the headline homebuilder sentiment reading sits 3 points above the spring 2020 low. Similarly, Present Sales and Traffic are down to the lowest level since April 2020 while Future Sales have actually surpassed those levels to now sit at the weakest reading in over a decade.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-1.png))**

> Last month, we highlighted how the geographic breakdown of sentiment was showing homebuilders in the Northeast being much more optimistic than their counter parts in the rest of the country. In November, that region joined the rest of the pack with a massive 17 point decline. That ranks as the third largest monthly decline on record behind a 19 point drop in June 2010 and the 45 point decline at the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. While that has not been enough to result in a new low, similar to sentiment in the Midwest, sentiment in the South is down to the lowest level in a decade. The same could be said for the West although it rose marginally month over month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-3.png))**

> As for the reaction of homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) is trading 1.1% lower as of this writing. As shown below, after last week's equity market surge on CPI in which the group moved not only above its 50-DMA but also its 200-DMA, ITB has continued to hold above its moving averages for now. Without much follow through on the post-CPI surge, any move above last week's highs would be a welcome bullish sign, whereas the 200-DMA is looking to be the critical level of support for the time being.

* **He says the company “failed to accurately predict how this would all play out and the impact it would have on our business.”**

The email from Carvana CEO Ernie Garcia, titled “Today is a hard day,” cites economic headwinds including higher financing costs and delayed car purchasing. He says the company “failed to accurately predict how this would all play out and the impact it would have on our business.”

The layoffs mainly impact employees in Carvana’s corporate and tech departments as well as some operational roles where it is “eliminating roles, locations or shifts to match our size with the current environment,” according to the letter.

Garcia said impacted employees will receive separation and severance pay, extended healthcare coverage for three months and other other benefits.

“To those impacted, I am sorry,” Garcia said. “As you all know, we made a similar decision to this one in May. It is fair to ask why this is happening again, and yet I am not sure I can answer it as clearly as you deserve.”

Enphase ($ENPH) will be the best risk-reward short over the next few months,17,yymj6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yymj6y/enphase_enph_will_be_the_best_riskreward_short/,28,1668784651.0,"I'm going to make this post short, because there's a lot of material out there already showcasing this phenomenon, but tl;dr is that indexes like the NASDAQ 100 have a track record of adding trendy stocks into the index around the stocks' ATH, and end up bag-holding the stock as it's valuation comes back to reality. Examples are: Atlassian, Peloton, Okta, Match, Zscaler, Lucid, etc. over the past 2 years.

That's not to say that they only choose losers, but in situations where speculative, ""story"" companies without the financials to back it up gain massive momentum, it's not surprising to see them lose most of their gains once added. It's not the indexes job to try and sift through the best company based on merit or valuation. Rather it's based on performance and market-cap which is out of their control.

All that being said, $ENPH will be added to the NASDAQ 100 on Monday 11/21 and ironically replace $OKTA. Enphase is interesting because it's an energy company valued like a speculative, growth tech stock. It's nearing its 52 wk-high and on the verge of breaking out to the upside. Unsurprisingly, it's done well this year while energy has done great. When does that narrative change? I'm not here trying to call the peak on the energy rotation, but the odds are good enough for me. The next few weeks are absolutely crucial for Enphase to retain its bullish narrative, but if it cracks it'll come down hard.

I am short $ENPH now, but am cautious of it's performance over the next couple of weeks. It could have a crazy move to the upside in the near-term off of index inclusion momentum and if that happens, I will be adding to my shorts.",2022-11-18 17:17:31

Can COIN recover?,90,yyje8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yyje8f/can_coin_recover/,193,1668776026.0,"COIN is on an ATL and the whole posse with Celsius and now FTX takes a lot of trust from CEX and generally from the whole crypto space.

Now, COIN is directly linked to the crypto space. And even if the stock market bounces back, it doesnt mean that the crypto market does the same.   


My thesis is that the stock market recovers before the crypto does. But, and here comes the bet, once we are again in a bull market within the crypto space, COIN will flourish again as the most trustworthy CEX in the space. Everybody and their aunt is going to buy again shitcoins and will do it with COIN, since nobody wants to see another mess like with FTX.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

# A note from CEO Andy Jassy about role eliminations - Thursday, Nov 17, 2022:

Two weeks ago, Beth shared that S-team and I decided to pause new incremental hires in our corporate workforce. Today, I want to share some information about role eliminations. We are in the middle of our annual operating planning review where we look at each of our businesses and make decisions about what we believe we should change. Leaders across the company are working with their teams and looking at their workforce levels, investments they want to make in the future, and prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. This year’s review is more difficult due to the fact that the economy remains in a challenging spot and we’ve hired rapidly the last several years.

Yesterday, we communicated the difficult decision to eliminate a number of positions across our Devices and Books businesses, and also announced a voluntary reduction offer for some employees in our People, Experience, and Technology (PXT) organization. Our annual planning process extends into the new year, which means there will be more role reductions as leaders continue to make adjustments. Those decisions will be shared with impacted employees and organizations early in 2023. We haven’t concluded yet exactly how many other roles will be impacted (we know that there will be reductions in our Stores and PXT organizations), but each leader will communicate to their respective teams when we have the details nailed down. And, as has been the case this week, we will prioritize communicating directly with impacted employees before making broad public or internal announcements.

I’ve been in this role now for about a year and a half, and without a doubt, this is the most difficult decision we’ve made during that time (and, we’ve had to make some very tough calls over the past couple of years, particularly during the heart of the pandemic). It’s not lost on me or any of the leaders who make these decisions that these aren’t just roles we’re eliminating, but rather, people with emotions, ambitions, and responsibilities whose lives will be impacted. We are working to support those who are affected and trying to help them find new roles on teams that have a need; and in cases where that’s not possible, we are offering packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support.

Amazon has weathered uncertainty and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so. We have big opportunities ahead, both in our more established businesses like Stores, Advertising, and AWS, but also in our newer initiatives that we’ve been working on for a number of years and have conviction in pursuing (e.g. Prime Video, Alexa, Kuiper, Zoox, and Healthcare). The key will be to do what Amazon does best – obsess over customers and invent relentlessly on their behalf – and if we do that, we should all be very optimistic about Amazon’s future. I know I am.

I want to thank each of you for your continuing contributions during this challenging time and as we gear up to deliver for customers during the busy shopping season.

Thanks,Andy

My brokerage account (correct terminology: Portfolio) is down 36%. I worked hundreds of hours of overtime to build up my portfolio. I am just sick of checking it every 6-8 weeks and seeing everything red. I know a 17 month span in the stock market is not very long - but it pains me to see if I had just docked away money in a savings account I would have $14k more than I do right now. 
Right now I see all these analysts like Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson saying we are going to have another dip. Many analysts see the S&P dipping below 3,000 by year end. Part of me says buy up SDOW and SQQQ to make a profit off any economic downturn. Not gonna lie - I’ve gone halfway there. I sold almost all of my stocks (TSLA, GOOG, AAPL) and sold half of my ETF holdings (VOO, QQQ). 
Pretend I was your son or grandson. What would you tell me to do? At the very least me selling what I did for a loss should help for tax season. My gut tells me to not buy back into this market until we are for sure out of the mess we are in (inflation wise). Would it better to buy back into VOO, QQQ and put a note over my password binder “Do not sell anything until retirement!” My ultimate goal is to build such a big portfolio that I can invest in just dividend ETFs and make a few hundred dollars a month.

* **That timeframe is years ahead of schedule and what many expected was possible.**

General Motors expects its new electric vehicles to be in-line with traditional cars and trucks with internal combustion engines by 2025 – years ahead of schedule and what many expected was possible.

GM CEO Mary Barra on Thursday said the significant increase in profits factors in federal incentives under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which includes money back for companies that produce EVs in North America as well as consumers and fleet customers that purchase the vehicles.

“It’s clear these credits are going to help usher in a new era of technology innovation and job creation that’s going to achieve what was intended,” Barra said during an investor day in New York. “It will be good for the American economy. It’ll be good for American families. It’ll be good for the environment, and frankly, General Motors is well poised.”

Near-term profitability plans for EVs as well as its outlooks for the economy and business during a period of rising interest rates, surging inflation and recessionary fears were expected to be focus points for investors and analysts during the event in New York.

GM is bullish on its profits and plans regarding EVs largely thanks to its investments in recent years on a new vehicle platform called Ultium as well as ongoing construction of domestic plants through a joint venture called Ultium Cells LLC with LG Energy Solution.

The joint venture is expected to be operating plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan by the end of 2024, which would make the company a leader in domestic cell production; a fourth U.S. cell plant is planned.

Wells Fargo Colin M. Langan is “skeptical” that GM’s electric vehicles can be sustainably profitable by 2025, even with incentives in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. He said pricing and raw material assumptions will be key.

“At the last Investor Day, GM promised ICE-like EV margins by 2030. Since then, battery raw material costs have dramatically spiked; therefore, it would be surprising if GM can still see EV profitability by 2025,” Langan wrote Tuesday.

GM previously said it secured binding commitments for all the battery raw material it needs to deliver its 2025 electric vehicle capacity target of 1 million vehicles. The company also has plans for capacity of 1 million EVs in China by then as well.

U.S. weekly jobless claims drop; housing market struggling,191,yxuxxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yxuxxt/us_weekly_jobless_claims_drop_housing_market/,69,1668703363.0,"*  **Weekly jobless claims fall 4,000 to 222,000**
* **Continuing claims increase 13,000 to 1.507 million**
* **Housing starts drop 4.2% in October; permits fall 2.4%**

WASHINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, showing widespread layoffs remain low despite a surge in technology-sector job cuts that has raised fears of an imminent recession.

The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, suggested the labor market remained tight. That, together with strong retail sales growth in October, will keep the Federal Reserve on track to continue raising interest rates, though at a slower pace amid signs inflation is starting to subside.

""This is a testimony to how tight the labor market remains,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Nov. 12, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 225,000 claims for the latest week.

There has been an increase in layoffs in the technology sector, with Twitter, Amazon and Meta, the parent of Facebook, announcing thousands of job cuts this month. Companies in interest-rate sensitive sectors like housing and finance are also letting workers go.

The layoffs have so far not been evident in official data. Unadjusted claims dropped 6,101 to 199,603 last week. Claims in California, the epicenter of the technology job cuts, rose by only 302 last week. Big decreases in claims were reported in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Indiana and Texas, offsetting notable increases in Minnesota and North Carolina.

Economists say businesses outside the technology and housing sectors are hoarding workers after difficulties finding labor in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. With 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person in September, some of the workers being laid off are probably finding new employment quickly.

Economists at Goldman Sachs dismissed worries that the technology layoffs were flagging an imminent recession in a note this week. They argued that technology job openings remained well above their pre-pandemic level. They also noted technology-sector layoffs have not historically been a leading indicator for deterioration in the overall labor market.

""Announced tech job cuts have frequently spiked without a corresponding increase in cuts in other sectors and have otherwise been a coincidental indicator,"" they wrote.

The Fed has raised its policy rate by 375 basis points this year from near zero to a 3.75%-4.00% range as it battles high inflation in what has become the fastest rate-hiking cycle since the 1980s. So far, the economy is weathering the tighter monetary policy storm, with data on Wednesday showing strong retail sales growth in October.

U.S. stocks opened lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

## HOUSING STARTS FALL

The claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of November's employment report. Claims rose marginally between the October and November survey periods, suggesting another month of solid job growth. The economy created 261,000 jobs in October.

Next week's data on the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid will shed more light on November's employment report. The so-called continuing claims, a proxy for hiring, increased 13,000 to 1.507 million in the week ending Nov. 5, the claims report showed.

But the housing market is crumbling under the weight of higher borrowing costs.

A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed housing starts decreased 4.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.425 million units last month. Economists had forecast starts would slide to a rate of 1.410 million units. Housing starts dropped 8.8% on a year-on-year basis in October.

Single-family housing starts, which account for the biggest share of homebuilding, tumbled 6.1% to a rate of 855,000 units, the lowest level since May 2020. Single-family homebuilding declined in all four regions.

Starts for housing projects with five units or more slipped 0.5% to a rate of 556,000 units. Multi-family housing construction has fared better as soaring mortgage rates force many potential homebuyers to remain renters. A key gauge of rents surged by the most on record on a year-on-year basis in October, according to the latest consumer price data.

The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is averaging above 7%, the highest level since 2002, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.

Data on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders fell for an 11th straight month in November.

Permits for future home construction fell 2.4% to a rate of 1.526 million units in October. Single-family building permits dropped 3.6% to a rate of 839,000 units.

Permits for housing projects with five units or more slipped 1.9% to a rate of 633,000 units.

Earlier this week, retail earnings have been less than merry. Both Walmart and Target reported a noticeable pullback of sales in categories like apparel, electronics and home goods as shoppers spent more on necessities. Target slashed its targets going into the holiday season, saying weaker sales have continued into November.

Macy’s, by contrast, stood by the revenue guidance it gave in August, saying it still expects a range of $24.34 billion to $24.58 billion for the fiscal year.

Fed’s Bullard says rate hikes have had ‘only limited effects’ on inflation so far. Says funds rate upper bound could be closer to 7%.,1413,yxqd7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yxqd7u/feds_bullard_says_rate_hikes_have_had_only/,320,1668691943.0,"St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Thursday the central bank still has a lot of work to do before it brings inflation under control. A voting member on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, Bullard delivered remarks centered on a rules-based approach to policymaking. Using standards set by Stanford economics professor John Taylor, Bullard insisted that the moves the Fed has made so far are insufficient. Even using assumptions he characterized as “generous” regarding the progress the Fed has made so far in its inflation fight, he noted in a series of slides that “the policy rate is not yet in a zone that may be considered sufficiently restrictive.” “To attain a sufficiently restrictive level, the policy rate will need to be increased further,” he added in the presentation.

There’s little if any dissent on the Fed over whether rates need to continue to rise. Most members have suggested a few more increases over the next several months that will take the central bank’s benchmark overnight borrowing rate to around 5% from its current target range of 3.75%-4%. However, Bullard’s presentation argued that 5% could serve as the low range for the where the funds rate needs to be, and that upper bound could be closer to 7%. That is well out of sync with current market pricing, which also sees the fed funds rate topping out around 5%.

Why invest in CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD),19,yxk6rx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yxk6rx/why_invest_in_crowdstrike_holdings_crwd/,20,1668671460.0,"First up is CrowdStrike, a leader in the cybersecurity world. CrowdStrike’s line of products, featuring its Falcon Endpoint Protection, offers users the industry standard in digital security for online and network protection. The company’s product line includes a wide range of cloud modules through the Software-as-a-Service subscription model.

CrowdStrike won’t report its next quarterly numbers until the end of this month, but we can get a feel for the company’s strong niche by looking at its last quarterly release, for fiscal 2Q23.

To start with, the company has recorded powerful gain in revenue and earnings in recent quarters. The most recent report showed $535.2 million at the top line, an increase of 58% year-over-year; the gain was driven by a 60% y/y increase in subscription revenue, to $506.2 million. Annual recurring revenue (ARR), an important indicator of future income, rose to $2.14 billion in fiscal Q2, up 59% y/y.

The company’s top line gains unsurprisingly came along with solid additions to the customer base. CrowdStrike reported a record quarterly gain of 1,741 new customers in its 2Q23 release.

These gains all led to the fifth quarter in a row of sequential EPS gains. The non-GAAP EPS was reported at 36 cents, up from 31 cents in fiscal Q2 and more than double the year-ago figure.

Lastly, the company showed an impressive cash flow in the quarter. Cash from operations rose 94% and hit a total of $210 million. This included an 84% y/y gain in free cash flow, to $136 million.

At the same time that the company has been posting solid financial results, its share price has also suffered from the twin blows in increasing inflation and increasing interest rates. CRWD stock is 30% down so far this year.",2022-11-17 09:51:00

Roth IRA advice for 2023 earned income,1,yxfk3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yxfk3i/roth_ira_advice_for_2023_earned_income/,7,1668656624.0,"I was a part of the big 2020 layoffs and didn’t start working again until 2021. I didn’t even earn $6,000 in 2020. 

Now I have a steady job but you never know, I’m sort of spooked from my past experience but at the same time I want to make sure I earn $6,500 first before just depositing and spending it all January 1st. I know some people do that. 

Should I want until I earn $6,500 first then deposit that amount and buy? That way if I get laid off the next day at least I had the earned income and don’t have to have a complicated situation of withdrawing what I didn’t earn. Seems like a mess. 

Is there an option of depositing $6,500, then from there just buying as I have the earned income? Such as once every two weeks? 

Or do I “risk” it and spend the $6,500 January first and just hope I don’t get laid off the next two months? 


I have a decent emergency fund set aside 


I probably made this more complicated than it should be, but being laid off and not working until the next year definitely wants me to play it safe with earning the income first

Is there that much of an advantage in the search engine where it would be too difficult for a large company like Microsoft to improve theirs? I feel like people gravitate towards google search just because people have heard from others that it is the best. What if Apple rejects the cash payment they get from Google for making their search engine the default for iPhones? Will people really care to use another system, honestly I don't notice too much of a difference. 

Also I have noticed people are starting to realize and care way more about online privacy. This could be a threat as people opt for more private search engines such as duck duck go. 

Would love to hear other people's opinions on this.",2022-11-17 04:58:59
Recession indicator: U.S. shrinking container freight shows slipping consumer spending on merchandise,288,yxdn8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yxdn8w/recession_indicator_us_shrinking_container/,89,1668651359.0,"LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Container freight volumes at the largest U.S. ports were down 3.8% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, confirming the slackening of merchandise trade and downturn in the business cycle.

The ports of New York-New Jersey, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Savannah, Houston, Norfolk, Charleston, Seattle and Oakland account for the overwhelming majority of container ocean freight into and out of the United States. The total volume of loaded containers handled by these nine ports amounted to 2.67 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in September 2022, down from 2.77 million in September 2021 and 2.85 million in September 2020.

The same slowdown was evident on the railroads, where the number of containers originated fell to 1.09 million in September 2022 from 1.14 million in September 2021 and 1.22 million in September 2020. Parcel delivery services have experienced an even steeper drop; FedEx reported U.S. deliveries were down by around 10% in the three months from June to August compared with a year earlier.

Chartbook: [**U.S. container trade**](https://tmsnrt.rs/3EC3xz1)

Freight is reflecting a significant slowdown in consumer spending on merchandise over the last 12-15 months as economies have re-opened after the pandemic and spending has rotated to travel and other services. Real consumer spending on merchandise in the three months from July to September 2022 was down by around 3.5% compared with the peak between April and June 2021, after adjusting for normal seasonal variations.

U.S. manufacturers reported barely any increase in activity in October, with the weakest reading in the Institute for Supply Management’s business survey since the pandemic and before that the mid-cycle slowdown in 2015/16.

The economies of the United Kingdom and the euro zone have already slipped into recession during the third quarter of 2022 and China’s manufacturing activity is contracting.

U.S. manufacturers and the rest of the economy is following the same trajectory, albeit the slowdown is likely to be shallower and shorter than in other regions which are more exposed to high energy prices and the conflict in Ukraine. 

As the global manufacturing sector contracts, freight volumes are likely to shrink further, which will eventually relieve some of the pressure on diesel fuel supplies.

> Just weeks after President Joe Biden issued a mass marijuana pardon and directed a review of the drug’s scheduling status, the U.S. Senate approved House-passed bipartisan cannabis research bill on Wednesday. It marks the first time a standalone piece of marijuana reform legislation has ever been sent to the president’s desk.

> The bill “would eliminate the red tape that hinders cannabis research, opening the door for new innovative treatments derived from cannabis,” Schumer said ahead of the vote. “If you’re one of the millions of Americans who deals with conditions like Parkinson’s or epilepsy or post-traumatic stress, or any number of other conditions, cannabis might hold promising new options for managing these diseases.”

> Just before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on the floor that he is continuing to have “productive talks” about a broader package of cannabis reforms he hopes to pass before the end of the lame duck session.

ANy future pivot would start with first slowing the rate hikes, and they've already hinted at so. Since fed consensus is of 0.5 % hike in december. Isn'st this a 100% proof of first stage of fed pivot, which is by slowing the pace of rates from 0.75 to 0.5 ? why isn't this the single most dependable fact that the fed has already made its move to slowing the pace now, and  it will be followed by potentially a pause in 2023 ?I mean why is there even a debate anymore on fed pivot ?",2022-11-17 01:30:59
Nvidia revenue falls 17% but data center growth remains strong,680,yx76kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yx76kp/nvidia_revenue_falls_17_but_data_center_growth/,209,1668634983.0,"* Nvidia reported fiscal third-quarter results on Wednesday for the period ending in October with sales beating analyst expectations but earnings per share coming in light.
* Nvidia is closely watched by analysts and investors as a leading indicator for the health of the technology industry, because it sells chips and software to so many PC makers and cloud providers.

Nvidia reported fiscal third-quarter results on Wednesday for the period ending in October with sales beating analyst expectations but earnings per share coming in light.

Nvidia stock rose over 1% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates:

* **EPS**: $0.59, adjusted, versus $0.69 expected
* **Revenue**: $5.93 billion, versus $5.77 billion expected

Nvidia said it expected about $6 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, lower than Refinitiv consensus estimates of $6.09 billion.

Gross margin for the third quarter was down 11.6 percentage points to 53.6%, which the company attributed to taking an inventory charge because of low demand for data center chips in China. Revenue was down 17% on a year-on-year basis.

Nvidia is closely watched by analysts and investors as a leading indicator for the health of the technology industry, because it sells chips and software to so many PC makers and cloud providers.

In the past few months, chip companies like Nvidia have been slashing order expectations and warning that their customers are overstocked with computer parts. In May, Nvidia said it would slow the pace of its hiring.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement that the company was “adapting to the macro environment.”

The PC gaming market is slowing after the pandemic boom. Nvidia graphics cards, which had been hard to find in stock in 2020 and 2021, are now seeing retail discounts. Nvidia also recently announced a new generation of graphics cards which are priced higher than the previous models.

Nvidia’s gaming division reported $1.57 billion in sales, down 51% year-over-year. Nvidia said it was selling less to retailers because they have more inventory than current demand. It said that macroeconomic conditions, in addition to China’s zero-Covid policy, are hurting consumer demand.

A brighter spot was Nvidia’s data center business, which reported $3.83 billion in sales, up 31% year-over-year. Nvidia attributed the growth to sales to U.S. cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.

In July, Nvidia cut its guidance for the October quarter. Nvidia also warned in August that it would be hit by U.S. export controls that prevent some fast artificial intelligence chips from being sold to Chinese companies. In November, it revealed a new chip that is designed to meet the U.S. export rules.

Nvidia said that the reduced sales from the GPUs barred in China would be largely offset by its alternative products.

Nvidia has a few smaller lines of business, including professional visualization and automotive chips. They are small. Professional visualization shrunk 65% on an annual basis to $200 million. Automotive grew 86% but is still very small, reporting $251 million in sales.

The company’s “other” category reported $73 million in revenue. It includes Nvidia’s cryptocurrency mining chips (CMP). The company said sales from the CMP chips were “nominal.”

Nvidia said it spent $3.75 billion on share repurchases and dividends during the quarter.

I looked at the last 5 years and its return is about 23% plus the dividend. So maybe 7% or so?

Would it be worth holding vs. VTI?

In the last 5 years it seems to bottom around $35 and top at about $60 so I suppose its a relatively low risk trading type of stock where you could add at under $40 or $40 and hold till $60 or so (or just accumulate that way) and collect dividend in mean time.

So is the appeal low beta and an ok dividend?",2022-11-16 23:37:44

"Growing very tired of PDT restrictions, what are my options for getting around it?",0,yx0qmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yx0qmm/growing_very_tired_of_pdt_restrictions_what_are/,36,1668621278.0,"I’ve been trading for a year and trading within these restrictions is really getting on my nerves, especially in the current market.

From those of you that started out with small accounts and broke free of this, what is the best way to get out?  And by small I mean keeping trades under $1000?

I trade options daily and I’ve limited my moves to around $400 per move while I learn. I lost $6k in my first 7 months. Y/o/Y I’m down $1700. The majority of my early losses have some type of PDT implication ie: holding gains too long b/c I didn’t want to burn a day trade etc. or not being able to get out of a trade at all.

Now that I’ve traded for a while I’ve been doing a combination of overnight moves (usually straddles), using multiple brokerages, and hedging to get around it. It’s all very annoying and adds an extra unnecessary layer of planning and strategy, to an already difficult market. I hate PDT with a passion.

Cash only accounts take too long to settle and screws up my timing.

Offshore accounts ala Tiger charge excessive amounts per trade and are riskier and not preferred.

I was considering saving up/depositing $13,000 and doing a margin account, filling in the other $13,000 and continuing to trade with my $1000 limit. I’m disciplined and wouldn’t touch the $25k but I’ve never done margin before. Would this even work or do you need $25k cash deposited still vs $13k + $13k margin?

Any other recommendations?",2022-11-16 19:54:38
Does a good dividend yield influence your likelihood of cashing in on gains?,2,yx0in3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yx0in3/does_a_good_dividend_yield_influence_your/,9,1668620793.0,My example of this is that I was lucky with timing and bought WBA at $31.

Taking the gains from this purchase with the thought that the market will dip again and I will increase my cash to enter VOO down the road. My portfolio being in the red for so long it makes me want to take some gains where I can get them.

Fed’s Daly sees rates rising at least another percentage point as ‘pausing is off the table’,81,ywzrii,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ywzrii/feds_daly_sees_rates_rising_at_least_another/,25,1668619251.0,"San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said Wednesday she expects the central bank to raise interest rates at least another percentage point, and possibly more, before it can pause to evaluate how the inflation fight is going. Daly told CNBC in a live interview that her most recent estimate in the Fed’s summary of economic projections puts the benchmark overnight lending rate around 5%. She added that the right range is probably from 4.75% to 5.25% from its current targeted range of 3.75%-4%. “I still think of that as a reasonable landing place for us before we hold, and the holding part is really important,” she told Steve Liesman during the “Squawk on the Street” interview. “It’s a raise-to-hold strategy.” Thus far, the Fed has hiked the fed funds rate, which spills over into a slew of other consumer debt products, six times, including four consecutive 0.75 percentage point moves.

Daly said she sees a point where the Fed will be able to evaluate the impact of its hikes before moving higher, but that is not now. “Pausing is off the table right now. It’s not even part of the discussion,” she said. “Right now, the discussion is rightly around slowing the pace and ... focusing our attention really on what is the level of interest rates that will end up being sufficiently restrictive.”

# [Stock futures slip as investors await October retail sales data](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures dipped Wednesday as investors weighed another lighter-than-expected inflation report and looked ahead to retail sales data.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded marginally lower. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also fell slightly.
*****
> Those moves came after Target reported much weaker-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. The results weighed on futures and sent the stock down more than 13%. Target also warned of a weak holiday quarter.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a positive session, with the S&P 500 closing up 0.87% on Tuesday and the Dow adding 56.22 points, or 0.17%. The Nasdaq jumped 1.45% and is the only major average on pace to eke out slight gains for the week. The producer price index report, which measures wholesale prices, came in below expectations, which alleviated some of investors’ concerns around inflation.
*****
> Chinese technology stocks were among the best performers Tuesday, with the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF gaining 9.56% for its best daily performance since March 16. Nine out of 11 S&P 500 sectors rose, led to the upside by communication services and information technology. Both health care and materials posted slight losses.
*****
> Stocks have staged a solid run following last week’s better-than-feared consumer price index report. The S&P 500 last week posted its best weekly stretch since June and all the major averages are on track to finish the month with gains.
*****
> Some investors say a near-term retreat is on the horizon, however.
*****
> “In the short term, the market is very extended and overdue to pull back and digest the recent rally,” said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments.
*****
> Retail sales due out Wednesday could offer another look at consumer behavior amid inflation.

Are Unsexy US long term Bonds the new play?,1,ywqy7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ywqy7d/are_unsexy_us_long_term_bonds_the_new_play/,9,1668598146.0,"if you think bond prices only reflect their interest, you need to do some research. With bond interest rates being high, particularly on longer dated ones, when the interest rates drop, their prices will disproportionately increase. Yes, you actually can get 20-80% upside from longer dated bonds, provided your broker let's you buy them and you used the many available calculators to estimate the risk benefits. 

As a test, you can punch in the numbers for the past month when rates on longer dated bonds have begun to come down and see how much of an increase you would have had.

As an added bonus, most US treasuries are exempt from state taxes, but check with your tax person.

What you think are the potential of success or failure of UniDoc Health trying making healthcare acessibility to all?,3,ywojo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ywojo5/what_you_think_are_the_potential_of_success_or/,3,1668589279.0,"UniDoc’s virtual health clinics

Patients can phone in or walk into a pharmacy to book an appointment, just as they would when scheduling a regular doctor’s appointment.

The system will then automatically tell the patient which doctors are available and if they can see them right away.

Once a doctor is ready, the patient will walk into the “cube” or kiosk and a nurse will be readily available to work with them. 

The nurse will record the patient’s weight, blood pressure and vitals. All of that information is sent to the doctor through the electronic medical record (EMR) system, which is an authorized and legal way of transmitting medical data. This way patient data is stored safely, as opposed to the way it is handled in other forms of telemedicine like a Zoom call, where it may not be properly protected.

The doctor has the ability to remotely join the appointment anytime and interact in real time with the patient, control the instruments, and even call in a specialist if the patient requires one. 

UniDoc’s goals

UniDoc’s main goals are to reduce wait times in doctors’ offices for patients and doctors, as well as save time in the emergency room (ER). Patients can visit a UniDoc cube before going to the ER if they have a headache or cut, for example, and will be advised if the concern requires a visit to the ER. Baldassarre said this tool is also cost saving for the healthcare system. 

In addition, UniDoc is simplifying doctor checkups for people with chronic diseases. Asthma, diabetes and lupus, for example, can be life threatening if not continuously monitored. 

“What we’re trying to do particularly with OnPharm-United and their group, is that someone can literally just go to the local corner pharmacy to do these kinds of tests rapidly without having to commute and without the long appointments. The system will upload it so their doctor would get all the information that they need to continue a certain lifestyle,” he said.

Expanding UniDoc

UniDoc is already planning the future of its technology, hoping to expand globally for travellers. If a Canadian is visiting Italy for example, all they would need is their health card and they would be able to set up an appointment with their doctor back home through the kiosk. 

“Healthcare should be accessible to everyone. We really believe healthcare is not a privilege, healthcare should be a right,” Baldassarre said.

It marks the highest level of inflation since January 1982.

City and Bank of England economists had forecast that the latest data would show inflation jumping to 10.7 per cent, from 10.1 per cent in September, so today’s number is higher than anticipated.

The sharp rise comes after the hike in the energy price cap in October as a result of sky-high wholesale prices amid Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Anatomy of a basing pattern: PINS,0,ywgk8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ywgk8b/anatomy_of_a_basing_pattern_pins/,10,1668564260.0,"There have been lots of questions in this sub lately about how to know when is the right time to buy and I've commented in a few threads about watching for bases. It's a crucial chart pattern to learn because most stocks over time will follow the same pattern through market cycles. The context here is that we're in a recession bear market right now, which is very different from an event-driven bear market like the COVID crash. Recession bear markets don't end with sudden V-shaped recoveries, so you don't have to stress over potentially missing the bottom. You want to be patient and let the stages play out.

The 4 stages are pretty simple (I'm using some of my own language to describe them):

* Stage 1: The base
* Stage 2: The breakout and bull run
* Stage 3: The rollover
* Stage 4: The crash

Have a look at the chart of PINS, which beautifully illustrates the four stages:   [https://imgur.com/beAJjgW](https://imgur.com/beAJjgW)

The key is to wait for the 4th stage to end and a new stage 1 base to start forming. PINS is very clearly in that stage 1 base right now, and threatening to break out. The moving average on the chart is the 40-week EMA, which is commonly used to identify the long-term trend. The buy signal would be a strong close above the base and above the 40-week EMA.",2022-11-16 04:04:20

Today, I own $3 calls for Agenus (agen)  for Jan 20, 2023. The stock price is currently up 24 cents (8.2%) and the option went from out of the money to in the money at $3.17. Now, I would think that should be great for my options. But, the option is only up 4 cents or  8%. This is one of the most popular options for AGEN with good volume. For a high-priced stock that went ITM and up 8%, I would expect the option to increase by 3-5 times as much as the stock price, so 24%-40%. The intrisic value on the 6 calls (so 600 shares) I own since time of purchase should be up by $300 as the price has gone up 50 cents. But, the option is only up $40. 

So, what are the factors at play here?

I learned a valuable lesson.,149,yw6n3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yw6n3y/i_learned_a_valuable_lesson/,65,1668539517.0,"Had two kids since 2020. Had a small amount of debt (~8k) & 0 savings. Incurred more during Covid (An additional ~20k between the two of us) largely due to being furloughed, her making less while on mat leave & a cross country move. Got recalled to work. Decided to start investing in hopes of eventually capitalizing on the current market. Goal was to have enough for a down-payment in a few years.

Since June, managed to invest ~9k. Did tons of DD. Enjoyed it all. My ADHD made it all exciting, and addictive. It genuinely felt good knowing I was finally being an ""adult"", despite being in my early 30s.

Our bare monthly expenses (Rent, car, insurances, phone & internet bills, electricity, daycare) +/- $750 for food / formula / diapers is ~$4200

Household income is roughly 150k a year.

Realization set in once I stopped & realized I alone am paying MONTHLY $500 towards credit cards, $400 towards a loan and ~$300 for financing for furniture we needed.

Sold pretty much everything, thankfully only took about a $300 loss. Still holding on to about 2.5k worth of Amazon ($120 avg/share ) because the red number I'm seeing right now hurts my soul.

I feel conflicted. One hand, I thoroughly enjoyed the short lived experience. 8/10, will do again.

On the other hand, I feel stupid. I wasted money, time and I knew deep inside paying my debts was the right & smarter choice from the very begining. It's just hard throwing money at a debt mountain that seemingly never goes  down.

Thankfully, small sums of money. Going to be focused on getting the highest interest accounts to 0 & improving the credit scores in the process.

The advertising market is currently weaker than at any point during the coronavirus pandemic slowdown of 2020, Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav said at an investment conference Tuesday. If the ad market doesn’t improve next year, “it’s going to be hard” to hit the company’s $12 billion earnings forecast for 2023, Zaslav said at RBC’s Global TIMT Conference in New York. Zaslav’s comments signal a change in rhetoric from large traditional media executives who generally said this summer that advertising slumps weren’t significant for them even as digital media players saw a pullback. Advertisers have reduced spending as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to cool inflation, pressuring equities including media companies’.

Things got “a lot worse” during the past few months, Zaslav said. Warner Bros. Discovery has had its valuation cut in half this year. Other companies reliant on advertising, such as Snap, Meta and BuzzFeed, have all fallen more than 65% this year. Merging Discovery with WarnerMedia earlier this year has brought a series of unforeseen challenges because some assets were “unexpectedly worse than we thought,” Zaslav said. HBO went from making more than $2 billion in 2019 to losing about $3 billion last year as content spending surged, according to Zaslav. The CEO has changed course for HBO Max as it gets set to merge with Discovery+ next year, including eliminating low-rated shows and bigger budget movies made only for the streaming service.",2022-11-15 17:52:37

There was a slight move up this morning (around the time or posting) for the USD against others while the SPY dropped two dollars from 402 to 400. A very insignificant change if you ask me but it still baffles me how that correlation exists caused by even the smallest movements on the indexes... Could that possibly be algorithmic behaviour? Still, I can't get the reason behind it. 

Now when the FEDs actually hike the interest rates, I can understand the movements between the currencies... But how come the stocks get to have that effect as well? How long has this been happening for? And what are the reasons?

"Walmart raises outlook as groceries boost sales, inventory glut recedes",237,yvvutc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yvvutc/walmart_raises_outlook_as_groceries_boost_sales/,66,1668515524.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/11/15/walmart-wmt-earnings-q3-2023.html

Walmart said Tuesday that sales rose by nearly 9% in the fiscal third quarter, as Americans across income levels bought the company's low-priced groceries.

The discounter beat Wall Street's expectations for the quarter and raised its outlook to reflect that beat.

Here's what Walmart reported for the three-month period ended Oct. 31, according to Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.50 adjusted vs. $1.32 expected
Revenue: $152.81 billion vs. $147.75 billion expected
Walmart posted a net loss of $1.8 billion, or 66 cents per share, down from a profit of $3.11 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings of $1.50 per share. The retailer recorded a charge of nearly $3.33 billion, or $1.05 a share, as part of an opioid settlement.

'Pocketbooks are stretched'

Shoppers are watching how they spend, Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said. They are buying less-expensive proteins such as hot dogs, beans and peanut butter instead of pricier meats. They are waiting for sales events to buy items like TVs and air fryers and are spending less in the apparel and home categories.

""Pocketbooks are stretched,"" he said. ""People have less discretionary income or less disposable income to spend on things — and so they're looking for value.""

The discounter also made progress with an industry-wide headache: a glut of excess inventory. Walmart's inventory was up 13% year over year in the third quarter. That's down from 25% in the second quarter and 32% in the first quarter.

Rainey said Walmart has canceled orders, increased markdowns and cleared through the backlog of merchandise stuck at ports. He said about 70% of the inventory increase is from inflation rather than more units.

""From a unit perspective, we find ourselves in a much, much better place than we did in the first part of the year,"" he said.

Comparable sales for Walmart U.S. rose 8.2%, excluding fuel. The key retail metric includes sales from Walmart stores and clubs open for the at least a year, including remodels, relocations and expansions.

Walmart is navigating a more challenging backdrop as it gears up for the holidays. Inflation is near a four-decade high, driving up the prices of housing, gas and more. Competitors are dangling deep discounts to try to clear through excess inventory. And consumers are spending again on travel, dining out and other experiences.

As inflation runs hot, however, the big-box retailer has attracted higher-income shoppers. About 75% of its market share gains in food came from households that make more than $100,000 a year, Rainey said. The discounter saw that same pattern in the previous quarter. 

So far, he said the holidays are ""off to a pretty solid start,"" but ""consumers are using discretion in terms of what they're buying.""",2022-11-15 14:32:04

ETFs / Open-ended funds: What happens when a buy order is executed?,4,yvu231,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yvu231/etfs_openended_funds_what_happens_when_a_buy/,6,1668510516.0,"ETFs work quite similarly to normal stocks, while at the same time also having a bit of a difference in how they are created / maintained, due to the creation of those baskets and whatnot. What I'm curious about is the following:

1. What happens when I buy shares of an ETF? Is it the exact same as with a stock, where another participant sells me their shares of the ETF, thus resulting in a simple trade? But then how does the size/AuM of an ETF ever increase? Some ETFs have way more underlying assets (In $ amount, not how many securities are in the basket) than others, so I figured that it is due to the ETF being more popular and therefore more people being invested in it, similar to how closed-end funds get bigger by having more people invest in it (where the fund then buys the underlying with the received cash). But if all ETF trades are just trading existing ETF shares, how does an ETF actually grow in size / how do more ETF shares get generated?
2. An ETF is supposed to track some kind of underlying index most of the time. This is being done by buying securities making up that index. However, quotes on exchanges are supposed to be driven by supply & demand, i.e. if a security has a lot of buy orders, the price is supposed to increase. Can and does that happen with ETFs as well? Imagine an extremely large market buy order for an ETF is hitting the exchange. Will price be driven up? But that would mean that it doesn't correctly track the underlying anymore, since the underlying has not changed in price, unless that buy order was actually split up in buy orders of the different underlying securities (which goes back to my question 1)?

Order book matching: Do price quotes change when market orders are being matched?,4,yvtxb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yvtxb7/order_book_matching_do_price_quotes_change_when/,6,1668510116.0,"So, as far as I'm aware, there are two ways of calculating the quote that an exchange displays for a given security. One would be to take the average between the current bid and ask spread, the other is to simply take the last price at which a bid and ask have been matched and thus generated a trade.

In the second case, all quotes would be results of trades being matched: However, I'm now wondering how exactly ""supply & demand"" would impact the price as is always being said? It's not like the remainder of the order book of the security impacts the price itself. Is it just by virtue of indirectly making more matches of higher and higher prices when demand exceeds supply, due to participants inputting limit orders at higher prices in those cases?",2022-11-15 13:01:56

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

It is important to remember that the stock market and the economy are two different entities.,349,yv5obj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yv5obj/it_is_important_to_remember_that_the_stock_market/,38,1668445635.0,"As unemployment may rise, and other worsening economic data may come out over the next 6-12 months, it is important to understand that the market is not the economy. 

To help illustrate, in the GFC, the market bottomed in March of 2009 while unemployment peaked in October of 2009. The reason? Government stimulus and the fed lowering rates which increased asset multiples, thus increased stock prices.

So if you see bad economic news, it ***may*** be a good thing for the market since it is a signal that interest rates will be lowered, thus increasing asset prices, as well as possible stimulus. BUT! I caution anticipating that support this time around since inflation is still \~7%. So it will be interesting to see if the fed/government intervene as quickly as they did in 2020/2008.

Amazon plans to lay off approximately 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs starting as soon as this week, people with knowledge of the matter said, in what would be the largest job cuts in the company’s history.

The cuts will focus on Amazon’s devices organization, including the voice-assistant Alexa, as well as at its retail division and in human resources, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The total number of layoffs remains fluid. But if it stays around 10,000, that would represent roughly 3 percent of Amazon’s corporate employees and less than 1 percent of its global work force of more than 1.5 million, which is primarily composed of hourly workers.

Amazon’s planned retrenchment during the critical holiday shopping season — when the company typically has valued stability — shows how quickly the souring global economy has put pressure on it to trim businesses that have been overstaffed or underdelivering for years.

Amazon would also become the latest technology company to lay off workers, which only recently it had been fighting to retain. Earlier this year, the e-commerce giant more than doubled the cap on cash compensation for its tech workers, citing “a particularly competitive labor market.”

Changing business models and the precarious economy have set off layoffs across the tech industry. Elon Musk halved Twitter’s head count this month after buying the company, and last week, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced it was laying off 11,000 employees, about 13 percent of its work force. Lyft, Stripe, Snap and other tech firms have also laid off workers in recent months.

Brad Glasser, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.

The pandemic produced Amazon’s most profitable era on record, as consumers flocked to online shopping and companies to its cloud computing services. Amazon doubled its work force in two years, and funneled its winnings into expansion and experimentation to find the next big things.

But earlier this year, Amazon’s growth slowed to the lowest rate in two decades, as the bullwhip of the pandemic snapped. The company faced high costs from decisions to overinvest and rapidly expand, while changes in shopping habits and high inflation dented sales.

Amazon experienced a slight rebound in its latest quarter. But it has cautioned investors that growth could weaken again, possibly falling to its lowest pace since 2001.

What We Learned From Week 10 in the N.F.L.

The Anatomy of a Panic Attack

Giorgia Meloni and the Politics of Power Dressing
The company has told Wall Street that it has tightened its belt in the past and can do so again. Last week, Amazon executives met with institutional investors, according to three people, just as its stock sank to its lowest level since the early days of the pandemic, erasing $1 trillion in value since Andy Jassy took over as chief executive last year.

Mr. Jassy, who previously ran Amazon’s lucrative cloud computing business, has been closely scrutinizing businesses to trim costs quickly. He initially pulled back on a warehouse expansion that was supercharged during the pandemic, then moved to other parts of the company.

In recent months, Amazon has also closed or pared back a smattering of initiatives, including Amazon Care, its service providing primary and urgent health care that failed to find enough customers; Scout, the cooler-size home delivery robot, that employed 400 people, according to Bloomberg; and Fabric.com, a subsidiary that sold sewing supplies for three decades.

From April through September, it reduced head count by almost 80,000 people, primarily shrinking its hourly staff through high attrition.

Amazon froze hiring in several smaller teams in September. In October, it stopped filling more than 10,000 open roles in its core retail business. Two weeks ago, it froze corporate hiring across the company, including its cloud computing division, for the next few months.

That news came so suddenly that recruiters did not receive talking points for job candidates until almost a week later, according to a copy of the talking points seen by The New York Times.

Devices and Alexa have long been seen internally as at risk for cuts. Alexa and related devices rocketed to a top company priority as Amazon raced to create the leading voice assistant, which leaders thought could succeed mobile phones as the next essential consumer interface. From 2017 to 2018, Amazon doubled staff on Alexa and Echo devices to 10,000 engineers. At one point, any engineer getting a job offer for other Amazon roles was supposed to also get an offer from Alexa.

The company has sold hundreds of millions of Alexa-enabled devices. But Amazon has said the products are often low margin and other potential revenue sources such as voice shopping have not caught on.

In 2018, Echo and Alexa lost about $5 billion, said a person with knowledge of the finances. When Amazon introduced new devices this fall in an annual event, it was notably more restrained than past years when it had featured zany products like a sticky note printer and $1,000 home robot.

Amazon’s retail business, which covers its physical and online retail business and its logistics operations, has been under strain after the surge of demand and breakneck expansion during the pandemic. The company has said it has pulled back expansion plans, and has told investors it sees uncertainty with consumers.

“We’re realistic that there’s various factors weighing on people’s wallets,” Brian Olsavsky, the finance chief, told investors last month. He said the company was unsure where spending was heading, but “we’re ready for a variety of outcomes.”

# [Stock futures fall following the S&P 500′s best week since June](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> Stock futures traded lower Monday after the S&P 500 posted its biggest weekly gain in almost five months on the back of easing inflation data.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 49 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures declined 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slid by 0.5%.
*****
> The S&P 500 rallied 5.9% last week for its best week since June. Investors cheered a lighter-than-expected inflation reading, betting that the Federal Reserve would soon slow its aggressive tightening campaign.
*****
> “A notable shift has occurred in the market, with investors increasingly risk-on across asset classes,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research. “Technical indicators have improved dramatically, with investor sentiment, momentum, breadth, and risk factors all showing notable improvement.”
*****
> The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 8.1% last week for its best week since March, while the blue-chip Dow advanced 4.2%.
*****
> The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge or the VIX, fell 1 point to 22.5, hitting the lowest level since August. The VIX, which tracks the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500, had traded above the 30 point threshold for most of October.
*****
> Still, the Federal Reserve has given little signal that it could deviate from its tightening path anytime soon. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Sunday that, “We’re at a point we can start thinking maybe of going to a slower pace.” But, “we’re not softening. ... Quit paying attention to the pace and start paying attention to where the endpoint is going to be. Until we get inflation down, that endpoint is still a ways out there.”
*****
> Investors also digested news on the politics front over the weekend. Democrats will keep control of the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections, NBC News projected. The party will hold at least 50 seats after Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada held off challenges.
*****
> Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings season is set to continue, with a heavy emphasis on retail. Big retailers Walmart, Home Depot, Target, Lowe’s, Macy’s and Kohl’s are all slated to post numbers this week.

Before the Brexit vote in 2016, the capitalisation gap was $1.5trn in favour of London.

Pretty stunning capitulation of the London stock market. Some of this gap closing has been due to currency fluctuations, but that can still be largely attributed to the Brexit vote.

$TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. 

The twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it’s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it’s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. 

Elon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it’s stress maybe he’s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I’ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that’s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that’s not what I’m debating here.

Tesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. 

So Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. 

Tesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That’s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don’t look like a car maker. 

People love to talk about build quality. Clearly it’s not effecting sales but regardless it’s getting better and it’s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you’re delusional, it’s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. 

Cheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from “luxury” but it’s durable and practical. For $50k it’s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it’s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don’t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. 

Ford has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. 

VW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They’re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we’ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. 

Tesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. “Some years will be a little less some will be a little more.” Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. 

So the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. 

The economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don’t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won’t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it’s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who’s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.

China is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They’re moving into Europe, I don’t see them moving to North American markets soon. It’s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they’re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I’d buy their stock if they weren’t IOUs from the CCP. 

I haven’t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn’t include  FSD because it’s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don’t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. 

TLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, they’re an outlier and leader within the car industry with a forward PE of only 35 and earnings growth ~100% I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.

I'm a bit hung up on the PE however as it seems crazy high. That being said, I'm *assuming* this is justified given their guidance and growth prospects.

The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the change in the selling price of goods and services sold by producers. The PPI measures price change from the perspective of the seller. When producers pay more for goods and services, they are more likely to pass the higher costs to the consumer, so PPI is thought to be a leading indicator of consumer inflation.

Manchester United stock analysis and valuation - Great way to become a millionaire,162,yue6ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yue6ve/manchester_united_stock_analysis_and_valuation/,50,1668373491.0,"This week's casual valuation is Manchester United, one of the biggest football (soccer) clubs in the world, and a public company trading on NYSE.

As always, this post is not financial/investment advice, it is purely for educational/entertainment purposes. It is divided into quite some segments and I hope you enjoy it! Let's get started:

&#x200B;

**How does Manchester United make money?**

In the last twelve months (ending June 2022), the total revenue was £583m and is divided into 4 segments:

1. Broadcasting (37%) - TV rights & MANU TV (a monthly subscription offering for the fans in exchange for exclusive content)
2. Sponsorships (25%) - self-explanatory, related to the main sponsor, but also all the advertisements around the pitch
3. Matchday (19%) - Sale of tickets
4. Retail, merchandising, apparel (19%) - Sale of branded clothing

It is quite clear that the last 2 segments depend on the fans and whether they are willing to support the club or not. If we add the MANU TV portion on top, it is quite clear that the fans contribute at least 40% of the total revenue and are significant stakeholders. Therefore, they have every right to demand changes when it comes to the players/managers or even owners, as they keep the club alive to some extent.

**How does Manchester United spend money?**

Looking at the income statement for the same period, all of the expenses amounted to £692m, yes, higher than the revenue. We can divide this into 3 brackets:

1. Employee benefits (55%) - Related to the salaries of the players, managers as well as all of the staff employed by the club
2. Other operating expenses (23%) - One bucket where all the other expenses related to the operations are included
3. Amortization (22%) - Related to the contracts of the players signed

&#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

From the information above, it is clear that the club isn't profitable. Was it always the case? Not really. If we go back to 2018, the revenue earned was quite similar, but the expenses were £564m, leading to a profit of £25m (4% operating margin). Wait, but that is quite a low margin, isn't it? Absolutely! But that should not come as a surprise. Sports clubs in general are not a great investment, and we will see some examples below.

However, this isn't a start-up that will improve margins over time as it scales up. We're looking at a club that's 100+ years old and struggles to be profitable. So, how can we value it?

Of course, if we plug the numbers into a DCF, well, the outcome is, it is worthless! It's not creating wealth! Not only that, it has £124m in cash and £806m in debt (including unearned revenue)!

&#x200B;

**The wishful thinking valuation**

Let's perform a simple exercise, which I refer to as a wishful thinking valuation. In this scenario, the club's revenue increased by 40% (due to better and more lucrative sponsorship deals, higher apparel sales, more matches played in important competitions, etc). At the same time, the expenses are slightly lower, leading to an operating profit of around £150m.

In addition, let's also assume that the club is consistently successful in delivering this profitability over time. Are these unrealistic assumptions? Very likely.

Even in this case, the value of the football club is around £1,5b before adjusting for what's on their balance sheet. Once we do that, the value declines to roughly £800m. That's extremely low! In fact, that's about 45% of the company's market cap today (Keep in mind the company's share price is always in $ as it is trading on the NYSE, while the financial numbers are in £).

So, in the best-case scenario, under unrealistic assumptions, its value is under £1b.

Wait, that cannot be the case. This is one of the biggest clubs in the world with over 75m fans!

&#x200B;

**What's actually going wrong?**

*One of the fastest ways to become a millionaire is to become a billionaire and then buy a sports team.*

It's not only Manchester United that struggles to find a way to profitability, but almost all of the clubs! Football Benchmark has an annual report and one segment focuses on profitability. It covers the top32 clubs. The outcome? Back in 2016, all of the 32 clubs had a net loss of €156m on €7,7b revenue (I know, it's in €, who needed a third currency in this post, but well, it is what it is). In 2022, the loss was almost €2,7b on almost €10b in revenue.

There are only a handful of clubs that are public. Juventus is one of them, with the share price being down over 75% since 2001, Borussia Dortmund is a bit better with the share price declining just almost 60% since 2000.

Manchester United's share price is pretty much flat since 2012.

&#x200B;

**Emotional stock-price volatility**

There are many places where the emotions of human beings play and the stock market is definitely one of them. The share price of the football clubs also changes based on events that have overstated significance. Here are a few examples:

\- During the 2013 transfer period, Manchester United announced the signing of the midfielder Fellaini and the share price increased.

\- Manchester United's share price decreased over 9% on the speculation that the club might sign Ezequiel Garay.

It's not only Manchester United, take a look at the share price of Juventus, it went over 3x on the news of signing Ronaldo.

Don't get me wrong, these events have some (minor) impact on the success of the club during a short period of time. In the case of Ronaldo, it might even come with better sponsorship deals, higher ticket prices, and more apparel sales. However, it also comes with an additional cost (an obvious one, his salary!). In the long run, none of these events have an impact on the value of the clubs.

&#x200B;

**The transfer window**

When I was in university, I looked at this and thought, what is the most emotional period during the year? It has to be the summer transfer window.

So, I took a shortcut and looked at the performance of the share price of Manchester United since 2013 for the period between June 10th and September 1st. The outcome?

&#x200B;

||Manchester United|S&P500|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2013|\-1%|\-1%|
|2014|\-3%|3%|
|2015|7%|\-6%|
|2016|\-1%|4%|
|2017|\-1%|2%|
|2018|22%|4%|
|2019|\-4%|1%|
|2020|\-10%|12%|
|2021|11%|7%|
|2022|11%|1%|
|**Total compounded return**|**32%**|**29%**|

As always, not financial advice, but definitely a fun insight.

&#x200B;

**Pricing, not valuation**

In my opinion, this belongs in the ""Pricing, not valuation"" bucket. The same bucket as art, collectibles, watches, vintage cars, and the most expensive Pokemon Card. None of them produce cash flow, hence, applying the traditional financial models leads to the outcome that they are worthless. 

Is that the case? Not really.

They're worth as much as the price that the next person is willing to pay. This is the only way that the current owners can actually make money.

&#x200B;

Sports clubs seem like another toy/possession for billionaires as if they're going through a checklist.

An expensive car? Check

A yacht? Check

Private jet? Check

Seventeen properties? Check

Hmm, what else? Oh yeah, maybe a sports club!

&#x200B;

**Credit Suisse and their failed attempt to value Manchester United**

Back in 2015, Credit Suisse published an equity report valuing Manchester United. I'm not sure if anyone is reviewing valuations there, as this one was based on irrational assumptions. The valuation lead to the value of Manchester United being £2,5b. Here's how:

1. They assumed Manchester United will be profitable every single year in the future and the profits will increase over time. Comparing their forecasts to the actuals, they are quite far off. Not only that, but we already know the club is currently unprofitable.
2. For the calculation of the terminal value, they used **EBITDA** and applied a multiple. If anyone read the first part of the post, you already know that this is just dumb. using EBITDA excludes amortization that covers the players' contracts! Of course, this pushes the profitability up without taking all expenses and voila, the valuation is done. Not only that, the multiple used was 12x.

Apologies if the post was too long, I wanted to share all the information that I thought are relevant and I hope you enjoyed it.

TLDR: Buying a sports club is a great way to become a millionaire if you are already a billionaire.",2022-11-13 23:04:51
Thinking of going back to 50% cash...,0,yudgk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yudgk4/thinking_of_going_back_to_50_cash/,122,1668372023.0,"The last week we had a good rally and my portfolio is up pretty good from where it was.

50/50 i think is a good trade off for this environment.

Tom Lee says he sees us hitting 4400 next month and maybe so but I can still make gains with the 50% in the market.

The 50% cash will be added when ""opportunities arise"" either in certain stocks I hold or a broad index.

For example if we fall in the next couple weeks to 3600 or so I'll put risk on in QQQ again.

I think 3990 is a good high point to cut back.

Yes we may overshoot to 4200 or above but I'd rather have a good chunk of change to throw at a fall to 3500.

2. The US banking system suffer from large scale hacks.
3. Coordinated actions by entities who hold large amounts of dollars - selling with the intention of crippling the dollar.

In my opinion and not that I think it's likely worst case is 50% fall. That puts us at sp500 1995, just under 2000. I find this highly unlikely but I like to consider worst cases just for the heck of it.

More realistically I could see a fall to 3000 but I also put it slightly unrealistic at least till February or March if that and I'm not even sure.

So I'd say that from here a more realistic drop would be at most maybe 25% which to me isn't a big deal.

I think though there's more reason to believe we will first approach 4200 or 4300 and then maybe we could see a retest of 3500 or whatever.

But I always like to consider the worst case and to me 50% is really extreme although I'm sure there's some wack jobs that say we'll hit 2000 or lower.

I think with inflation finally coming down and Jeremy Siegel the other day saying ""inflation is done!"" On CNBC that we will have more upward pressure at least through December I think.

Seems like inflation is steadily peaking and the fed is going to be easing up on the rate hikes. However, am i correct to understand that the consequences of the high rates and inflation have yet to really hit the marker? 

It's a bit daunting to start investing with larger sums of money so i thought I'd run my plan by you guys, see what comes up. Any insights are highly appreciated.

I'm planning on eventually splitting the money between stocks/bonds about 65/35 ( 240/120k), and a small sum for crypto. I won't be picking individual stocks, but will go for broad ETFs. Currently thinking of 
- 40% world
- 30% s&p500
- 10% europe
- 5% emerging markets
- 5% health
- 5% energy
- 5% tech.

Given the high volatility and probability of another dip in the next year, I'd prefer to transition to ETFs slowly. Of the 240k allotted for etf's, I'd keep about 100k immediately available to ease into ETFs at ±10.000 a month (sometimes more, sometimes less depending on the situation at the time, but every month without fault) for the first 6 months of 2023. The other 140 I'd invest in short terms bonds (±6 months). So they become available when i need them at the 6 month mark. At that point i decide how to proceed ( get into ETFs quicker or again invest a percentage in short term bonds an repeat the proces), from there with hopefully a little more certainty about the state of the market.

My thinking is that this way i get the secure, relatively high returns from the short term bonds while easing into etf's and still having a small buffer available to invest larger sums should the market take a dive. Overall, I'd reach the 65/35 etf/bond ratio and become fully invested in 18-24 months. 

Ver interested to hear your thoughts. Any i sights are highly appreciated.

Thank you.",2022-11-13 04:09:44

Tesla officially makes its charging standard available to other companies in the U.S.,2082,ytlgev,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ytlgev/tesla_officially_makes_its_charging_standard/,325,1668295064.0,"Tesla is sharing its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America.

Tesla said in a blog post Friday that its design and specification files are available for download. The company said it is “actively working with relevant standards bodies to codify Tesla’s charging connector as a public standard.”

The charging connector in all Tesla vehicles offers AC charging and up to 1 MW DC charging. Its compact design and performance is considered superior to the Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors used by most EVs in North America.

Tesla claims that its charging connector and charge port — which it now calls the North American Charging Standard (NACS) — is the most common charging standard in North America. It’s a stat based on Tesla vehicle sales in North America and the number of chargers at its branded Supercharging stations. Tesla has nearly 1,500 Supercharger stations in the United States. Each station has an average of nine chargers.

Tesla didn’t name any automakers or charging infrastructure companies as converts. In this highly competitive environment, in which virtually every automaker is now using the CCS, it’s hard to see GM, Ford and Stellantis switching to Tesla’s technology.

However, at least one company — EV startup Aptera — supports the move. Earlier this year, Aptera called for the U.S. government to adopt Tesla’s Supercharger technology as the standard for all EV charging in the country. And EVGo has added Tesla connectors to some of its charging stations in the United States.

The company said in the blog post that network operators “already have plans in motion” to incorporate NACS at their chargers. If network providers like ChargePoint, EVConnect or Electrify America add NACS, it would allow Tesla owners to charge at these stations without a need for an adapter.

If automakers switch to NACS on its EVs, it would give owners of those vehicles access to Tesla’s North American Supercharging and destination charging networks.

How fast do prices of the same security tend to stabilize across different exchanges?,0,ytk88l,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ytk88l/how_fast_do_prices_of_the_same_security_tend_to/,5,1668291892.0,"Hi everyone,

there are plenty of securities that are listed on a variety of different exchanges, even within and across various geographical regions. Generally speaking, each exchange will have its own ""order book"", and therefore its own bid/ask spread that will determine the quote offered on that exchange.

The theory now says that any difference that might arise between various exchanges (Let's take Xetra Germany and Euronext Paris, for example - similar geographic locations, same currency, but different exchanges with mostly the same listings.) will be taken advantage of by arbitrage traders, typically some big HFT firms / liquidity providers.

That's the theory - but do we have any data about what the effects are in practice? How fast can I assume that prices will stabilize across two select exchanges? And can I make any assumptions on the potential spread that can arise as well? For example, let's say a large trade is being placed on one specific exchange. How long will it take for the impacted price of that trade to spread towards another exchange?

Out of pure curiosity, I've looked up a random Vanguard ETF on Xetra and on Euronext:

This week, they closed with a difference of nearly 2cents, which actually seems way bigger than I would have expected! Is this just an effect of those quotes being dependent on the last trade(s) before closing, and can I expect the difference to be far smaller & eliminated much quicker during the day? Any experiences with this?

&#x200B;

Also, does anyone know of any resources where I could download intraday pricing for a select few securities on for example the two exchanges above? That would be a quick way to statisically analyze the result of my question.",2022-11-13 00:24:52

Is it more or less short covering that make these type of stocks rally further than other stocks during upswings?

Anyways I'm thinking it's a good trade for a small portion of a portfolio to have some ARKK CARVANA or whatever to make a quick buck and then sell, especially if you're in the red this year as there won't be any gains.

Is there an etf other than ARKK that contains these types of stocks?

I'm thinking maybe IGY or Invescos extended tech etf, but I don't think it contains any weight in stuff like snap, cvna, amc, pton, etc.

I find it interesting that all these ""crap"" companies rallied like 14% the other day!

Must be short covering?

Why would shorts cover? Why do people rush back in to the no earning, risky stuff?

In previous post, I warned against speculating on a Fed pivot and I'm fully aware of the risk for semiconductors and other individual stocks that I own. But that is beside the point. The main question is: ""What level is enough?"" Numerous companies from Amazon to Apple and from Fed Ex to Target have warned of consumer confidence tanking and slowing sales. This is direct evidence of consumer demand falling which should lead to falling inflation. With guidance comes certainty and with certainty comes probability. The probability is that investors have potentially priced enough falling demand for companies and the effects of high inflation. Despite the recent rally we have had, most companies have still fallen 30% to 50% except for value and consumer staple stocks.

Another massive rally in this Bear Market - Where do we go from here?,327,ytfds8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ytfds8/another_massive_rally_in_this_bear_market_where/,238,1668279472.0,"So with another massive rally, many people are surely wondering if we've seen the bottom. Personally, I think we've seen the bottom for this year. It would take something new and unexpected to see new lows before end of year in my opinion.

For now, I think this rally has legs until January. Here's my rationale:

* We've likely reached peak inflation fear now that CPI has started rolling over.
* Fed rate hike odds and the fear surrounding that has also likely peaked, and appears to be priced in by bonds.
* More certainty in the markets post mid-term election.
* Hedge Funds / Money managers who need to ""catch up"" are going to press this thing. I expect a series of higher lows and higher highs like back in June-Aug.
* Positive seasonal trends (Christmas rally, January effect)

Now this doesn't mean we just rally non-stop, I think there's going to be a lot of chop and ultimately we can top out around S&P 4200. That said, after all that's done and the market has convinced everyone the Bear is dead, that's when we should start seeing the effects of the rate increases on the economy in Q2-4 next year. The only thing that matters at the end of the day are corporate profits and how high interest rates are.

The average forward P/E on the market over the last 10 years is 17x. That's with effectively 0% interest rates and QE. Before infinite QE and ZIRP, the average P/E multiple was around 15x.

Next year earnings (EPS) for the S&P are expected to be at around 230, so at S&P 4000 we're trading at a 17.5x forward P/E multiple (historically high).

Earnings will likely come down in 2023 as higher interest rates work their way through the economy. Looking at Analyst estimates for next year EPS, The Bear case is EPS of 200, Base case is 215, and Bull case is 230. 

Using the Base Case middle of the road EPS range for next year (215), let's assume a 16x multiple (which makes sense in a higher interest rate environment). That would put the fair value of the S&P for 2023 around 3440.

Obviously there's much more to it than just P/E, but this is the framework I'm using to think about the potential trading range we could expect in the coming months. Would love to hear others thoughts on this and challenge my biases.",2022-11-12 20:57:52

Friday's strong debut coincided with a rally in other U.S.-listed Chinese stocks after China eased its Covid-19 rules.

The company first filed its draft registration statement in April 2021 and planned to raise more than $300 million at the time. However, IPO activity among Chinese firms has been muted since the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which strengthens audit requirements, took effect.

> # Banks and Brokers on Fire

> The Financial sector ETF (XLF) has been on fire since its intraday low of $29.59 on October 13th, which was the day of the hotter than expected September CPI report. From that low point on 10/13, XLF is up 20.2%. As shown below, the ETF is currently at the very top end of a wide sideways range that has been in place over the last six months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/xlfchartuse.png))**

> Below is a sampling of some of the most well-known banks and brokers that are part of the Financial sector. As shown, names like Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Jefferies (JEF), Raymond James (RJF), and Stifel (SF) are all more than 10% above their 50-DMAs, and the only stock that's not overbought (>2 standard deviations above 50-DMA) is LPL Financial (LPLA), which traded lower on earnings yesterday.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/banksbrokersta.png))**

> A quick look at the six-month price charts of the stocks listed in the table above gives you a glimpse into the huge rally that this area of the market has experienced since early October. Investors have seemingly been loading up on them with short-term Treasury yields now significantly higher than the interest rates these banks and brokers are paying customers on deposits.

> # Homebuilders Extended

> Every day we browse through our Trend Analyzer tool (available with a Premium or Institutional membership) to monitor trends and overbought/oversold levels across financial markets. When we got to the homebuilder stocks this morning, we had to do a double-take after seeing some of the recent moves in this space. Have a look at the moves in the snapshot below. Most homebuilder stocks have rallied 12-15% over the last five trading days, leaving them in extreme overbought territory, which means they're more than two standard deviations above their 50-day moving averages. DR Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), NVR (NVR), and PulteGroup (PHM) are the most extended. Even after the rally in these names over the last week, we'd note that they're still all down sharply year-to-date as the spike in mortgage rates from 3% up to 7%+ has caused activity in the space to slow to a crawl. A drop in those mortgage rates over the last few days was the catalyst for the recent move higher in share prices. If you're wondering which way the homebuilders are likely to trade going forward, keep an eye on interest rates -- that's the entire story these days.

> # A Very Encouraging Inflation Report, Including Goods Deflation (Finally)

> One month does not make a trend, but today’s consumer price index (CPI) report was very positive. Dare I say, it’s probably the best inflation report we’ve seen in about 15 months, especially because there were so many encouraging signs in it. This is a huge relief, and markets appear to be responding in kind. S&P 500 futures were up more than 3% after the CPI report was released and as of lunchtime, the rally continued.

> Let’s walk through it.

> Headline inflation rose 0.4% in October, as expected. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food/energy prices, and is arguably more important for the Federal Reserve (Fed), surprised: rising 0.3% in October, below expectations for a 0.5% jump. This is the lowest monthly increase since September 2021.

> Looking back over the past year, headline inflation is up 7.8%. That’s high but that’s come down from 9.1% in June. A big part of the deceleration was falling energy prices – you can see how the lighter red bars have been making up a smaller portion of inflation over the past few months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-picture-headline-inflation-decelerating-578x800.png))**

> In the chart above, you can see that Food prices continue to make a big piece of inflation (dark red bars). But we got a break here as well. “Food at Home”, i.e. groceries (which make up close to 9% of the inflation basket), rose just 0.4% in October – the lowest in more than a year and well below the average 0.7% monthly increase we’ve seen over the first 9 months of the year.

> # The Goods Deflation We’ve Been Waiting For
> We’ve been talking about how private inflation data has been showing decelerating prices for goods outside energy and food. Just yesterday my colleague Ryan Detrick wrote about collapsing used car prices. Retailers have been telling us for a while that they’re discounting items as well. We’ve just been waiting for the official inflation data to catch up, and looks like it’s doing that, finally.

> There’s a broad list of goods, including used cars, that saw prices fall in October, which is what makes it even more encouraging. The items below make up about 11% of the inflation basket (and 14% of the core basket). Falling household goods prices probably reflect the slowdown in residential activity, as home sales collapse amid higher mortgage rates.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-table-goods-prices.png))**

> # Are Rents Breaking?
> The best part about goods deflation is that it offsets high services inflation. As you can see below, the blue bars are now below the zero line for the second month in a row. We also got good news in the form of medical care services – which was a function of falling health insurance premiums.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-picture-core-inflation-576x800.png))**

> The biggest part of the inflation basket is Shelter, including rents on primary residences and something called “Owners’ Equivalent Rent” (OER), which is the “implied rent” that owner-occupants would have to pay if they were renting their homes. The latter is also determined using rents of equivalent homes as I wrote about a month ago. In other words, OER is effectively a measure of rents, and altogether rents make up a whopping 40% of the core inflation basket.

> And rents have been rising, putting a lot of upward pressure on core inflation. You can see the gray bars in the previous chart growing larger and larger over the past year.

> However, market rents have been decelerating quite rapidly over the last few months – Ryan discussed this just yesterday. The problem is it hasn’t shown up in the official inflation data because of methodological reasons (we wrote about this quite extensively).

> But the official rental data may be beginning to turn. Rent of primary residence rose 0.7% month-over-month and OER rose 0.6% in October, which is lower than what we’ve seen over the previous couple of months. Make no mistake, a 0.7% rise is still a lot – that translates to an annualized pace of 9%, which is why the Fed is really worried about it. But hopefully, the October data is a sign that the official data is beginning to turn and follow the private data, lower.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-picture-rents-private-vs-offical-599x800.png))**

> # What does this mean for Fed policy
> Perhaps the most important question.

> As I said at the top, one month is not a trend. But this is not random. It jives with all the other leading indicators of prices, which have been showing a deceleration in prices. And now it looks like the official data is catching up.

> With respect to policy, Fed officials are unlikely to change their minds based on one report. They’ll probably need to see at least three of these before starting to view it as “convincing evidence” that inflation is on its way down.

> But what today’s CPI does is that it buys time. Yet another hot inflation print would have put more pressure on the Fed to raise rates even further. By coming out on the soft side, the report increases the odds for a “soft landing” scenario. In other words, inflation and wage growth can (hopefully) come down without the Fed having to ratchet rates higher and higher, which would eventually break the labor market.

> # Haves and Have Nots

> As evident in our Sector Snapshots over the past several days and as we discussed yesterday on Twitter, sector performance has lately been a tale of the haves and have-nots. The areas of the market that possess some of the most heavily weighted stocks, namely Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, and Technology, have drastically underperformed other cyclical sectors like Financials, Industrials, and Materials. As a result, relative strength lines have blown out. Shown another way, in the charts below, we show the ratios of each of these sectors relative to the S&P 500. A rising line would indicate the sector is outperforming the broader market and vice versa.

> Communication Services has been in a brutal downtrend in relative strength terms for more than a year now and the recent drop has been steep. While the ratio of Consumer Discretionary to the S&P 500 has been more range bound in recent years, there have been a few wild swings in the past year. The most recent swing lower is leaving it close to the lowest levels since early 2015. Tech's decline has not been nearly as sharp, but the ratio here has nonetheless rolled over to some of the lowest levels of the past few years. Conversely, Financials, Industrials, and Materials have all seen their ratios rip higher to the upper end of the past few years' range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110922-Ratiosa.png))**

> In measuring just how sharp of moves these ratios have experienced, they have been outright historic. As for the most pronounced moves, the drops in the lines of Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary rank in the bottom percentile of all 10-day moves since 1990 when our sector data begins. The only periods in which the ratios fell by similar degrees, if not by more, were during the Dot Com bubble. While Tech's ratio is at new multi-yea rlows, its decline was large (ranking in the 17th percentile) but not nearly as sharp, standing out much less than the aforementioned sectors.

> Like Tech, the moves in Financials and Materials have also been quite large and rank in the top decile of all 10-day moves, but those are far from records. The outperformance of Industrials on the other hand, has been remarkable. As of yesterday's close, the ratio versus the S&P 500 rose 7.24% over the past two weeks. Only three other days—May 19 through May 21, 2020—since 1990 have seen higher readings.

> # Small Business Labor and Inflation Slumping

> The NFIB released its October data on small business optimism this morning. The headline index was expected to show further deterioration in optimism, and exactly that occurred as the index fell to 91.3 from last month's reading of 92.1 versus expectations of 91.4. This month's reading is off of the spring lows which had surpassed the worst levels from the early stages of the pandemic but remains one of the weakest readings of the past several years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-1.png))**

> In the table below, we provide a breakdown of each category of the report. The headline index is now just off the bottom decile of readings as most components are likewise historically depressed. While the report was weak, there were some exceptions with strong showings in labor market metrics like Plans to Increase Employment, Job Openings Hard to Fill, and Compensation.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-Table.png))**

> Even though these labor market metrics have remained at very high levels from a historical perspective, they have largely been rolling over for the better portion of the past year. Hiring plans as well as the percentage of firms reporting cost or quality of labor as their biggest issues are back to similar levels as the year prior to the pandemic. Meanwhile, actual employment changes are negative (as they have been throughout the pandemic) implying businesses are reporting a net decline in workers. That is in spite of still elevated compensation and a sharp spike higher in compensation plans. In fact, that index is just shy of the peak from the final months of 2021 after a record 9-point month-over-month jump. Companies are also reporting job openings remain hard to fill, although that index has also been on the decline alongside hiring plans. This month, the reading was unchanged at 46, the lowest level since June 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-2.png))**

> Sales components have experienced far greater degrees of deterioration than employment metrics. The outlook for general business conditions has rallied back somewhat in the past few months, but it remains well below its historical range. Given the weakness in small businesses' economic outlook, few report now as an opportune time to expand their businesses. Actual sales changes dropped to -8 in October which matched August for the weakest showing for sales since August 2020. Back in 2020 though, this index was far lower than it is now.

> While the reading on the top line has held up relatively well, high inflation has meant the bottom line has taken a big hit. A net 30% of small businesses reported earnings have fallen. That reading did improve last month, though, as there have been fewer businesses reporting higher prices. In spite of those improvements, each of those indices has a long way to go until returning to what have historically been more normal levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-3.png))**

> As mentioned above, a historically low share of businesses are reporting positive sentiment on the economy and that has dampened their hopes of expansion. When questioned on the reason for not expanding, 44% reported economic conditions as the reason. Another 17% reported economic conditions as the reason for uncertainty on whether or not they would expand. Aptly coming out on Election Day, we have highlighted in the past the political nature of the NFIB survey. As such, it should come as little surprise that the next biggest reason for small business hesitancy in expanding has been the political climate. Assuming the survey results react to the current election in a similar way as in the past, a strong election showing for Republicans could provide a boost to small business sentiment and plans for expansion. Finally, given continued high inflation and rates rising to combat it, the next two most widely mentioned reasons to not expand were the cost of expansion and financial conditions and interest rates with a combined 9% of responses.

> # What's Bothering Small Businesses?

> As we noted in an earlier post, the pandemic trends of tight labor markets and high inflation continue to show up in the latest NFIB survey of small business optimism, albeit readings have begun to roll over. The survey also questions firms on what they perceive to be their most pressing problems. Perhaps even more than the other indices in the report, the results of these questions have shown how front and center labor and inflation concerns continue to be.

> As shown below, most problems have seen record or near-record lows. Meanwhile, two-thirds of responses report either cost or quality of labor or inflation as their biggest problem.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-Table.png))**

> At 33%, inflation as the single most important problem has well surpassed the previous record high set during what was a much less dramatic inflationary spell in 2008. Although this reading rose 3 percentage points versus September, it is in the middle of the past few months' range. In other words, inflation is slightly less of a concern than it was a few months ago (which is confirmed by the decline in the higher prices index), but that is certainly not to say it is no longer the single most pressing problem.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

> Another third of responses reported either cost or quality of labor as their biggest issues. Quality is the bigger concern of the two—which is normal from a historical perspective—accounting for a 23% share.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-4.png))**

> As we frequently note, the NFIB survey has a tendency to be impacted by politics with a bias towards Republican administrations. For example, during the Bush and Trump years, there was a far lower share of respondents reporting government requirements and taxes as their biggest concerns. With the prominence of inflation, Biden's tenure has resulted in a different scenario in which these issues have been placed on the back burner. Granted, these issues still account for the most pressing problem of a combined 17% of responses. We would also note, these readings have seen some dramatic moves around midterm election months, but those have not always been lasting.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-2a.png))**

> Finally, we would note that very few businesses (only 3%) are worried about poor sales. That is a record-low share and unchanged for the third month in a row. As we noted in our discussion of the other areas of the report, that lack of concern for the top line contrasts with businesses' hopes for expansion and the outlook for the economy. In fact, of the reasons given for firms reporting now as not a good time to expand, sales prospects were the least pressing reason given.

> # Beyond the Midterm Elections…Less Uncertainty and Historically Solid S&P 500 Performance

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a5f6008c34de7421fb4219e162491342/1e76828c24e4974c-2b/s500x750/6ec4edf19bebdc462cd466a8ca166dc72a5e9eaa.jpg))**

> It is finally Election Day and hopefully soon the results will start rolling in. Once the outcome is known, it will likely alleviate some of the uncertainty that has been contributing to the market’s volatile trading which could help the market snap out of its Fed-induced funk. In the chart above the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the last 18 midterm-year elections appear (NASDAQ since 1974). Prior to 1969 the market was closed on Election Day so the close on the day before was used. By 60 trading days after the election (approximately three months), DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ were higher on average from 6.4% to 9.2%.

> Digging deeper into the data, the following table shows S&P 500 performance 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months after the election. 1- and 3-months after the election S&P 500 was higher 77.8% and 88.9% of the time respectively. By 6-months and 1-year after, S&P 500 was always higher, although gains did slow after 6-months. Years when the President’s party lost its majority in Congress are shaded in gray.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/AIN_1222_20221103_Midterm_Election_Forward_Table.jpg))**

> The Sweet Spot of the 4-year cycle is now. The headwinds that abound this time around are not entirely unlike past midterm years that have historically been mired by bear markets and uncertain economic and political times. Many of the current concerns do appear to be accounted for by the market’s declines coming into Q4. Inflation does remain stubbornly high despite the Fed aggressively raising rates this year. The Fed’s most recent statement may not have been as dovish as some had hoped for, but it did contain language that suggested the time to slow the pace of increases and possibly even pause hikes is closer now than it was six months ago. The market is likely to remain volatile as it awaits more clarity from the Fed and more signs that inflation is easing. Any back and fill periods by the market are likely an opportunity to consider adding to existing long positions or establishing new longs.

"Disney to Begin Layoffs, Targeted Hiring Freeze and Limiting Travel",2041,ysr4xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ysr4xr/disney_to_begin_layoffs_targeted_hiring_freeze/,381,1668210914.0,"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/disney-layoffs-hiring-freeze-bob-chapek-1235430840/

 Disney will begin enacting layoffs, implementing a targeted hiring freeze and limiting company travel as part of a sweep cost-cutting move announced to leadership Friday.

In a memo obtained by Variety, which was sent to top execs Friday afternoon, Disney CEO Bob Chapek wrote: “I am fully aware this will be a difficult process for many of you and your teams. We are going to have to make tough and uncomfortable decisions. But that is just what leadership requires, and I thank you in advance for stepping up during this important time. Our company has weathered many challenges during our 100-year history, and I have no doubt we will achieve our goals and create a more nimble company better suited to the environment of tomorrow.”

Chapek says that Disney will also be conducting a “rigorous review of the company’s content and marketing spending,” with all of these efforts being overseen by newly formed “cost structure taskforce” comprised of Chapek, CFO Christina McCarthy and general counsel Horacio Gutierrez.

The layoffs and cost-cutting news hits four days after Disney presented rough quarterly earnings results, which sent the company’s stock tumbling to its lowest price in more than two years.

While the company saw subscriptions for Disney+, which launches its ad-supported tier Dec. 8, significantly surpass Wall Street’s expectations, Disney reported an operating loss for its streaming segment of $1.47 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 1, 2022, about $800 million more than the year-earlier period. Revenue increased 8% to $4.9 billion, which the company attributed to higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ and lower results at Hulu. Meanwhile, revenue for Disney’s linear television networks (pay TV and broadcast) dropped 5% in the quarter.

Chapek wrote Friday that these “cost management efforts,” which were hinted at by himself and McCarthy on the earnings call and are “occurring against a backdrop of economic uncertainty” affecting all of Hollywood, “will help us to both achieve the important goal of reaching profitability for Disney+ in fiscal 2024 and make us a more efficient and nimble company overall.”

Representatives for Disney did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.

See Chapek’s memo in full below.

Disney Leaders-

As we begin fiscal 2023, I want to communicate with you directly about the cost management efforts Christine McCarthy and I referenced on this week’s earnings call. These efforts will help us to both achieve the important goal of reaching profitability for Disney+ in fiscal 2024 and make us a more efficient and nimble company overall. This work is occurring against a backdrop of economic uncertainty that all companies and our industry are contending with.

While certain macroeconomic factors are out of our control, meeting these goals requires all of us to continue doing our part to manage the things we can control—most notably, our costs. You all will have critical roles to play in this effort, and as senior leaders, I know you will get it done.

To be clear, I am confident in our ability to reach the targets we have set, and in this management team to get us there.

To help guide us on this journey, I have established a cost structure taskforce of executive officers: our CFO, Christine McCarthy and General Counsel, Horacio Gutierrez. Along with me, this team will make the critical big picture decisions necessary to achieve our objectives.

We are not starting this work from scratch and have already set several next steps—which I wanted you to hear about directly from me.

First, we have undertaken a rigorous review of the company’s content and marketing spending working with our content leaders and their teams. While we will not sacrifice quality or the strength of our unrivaled synergy machine, we must ensure our investments are both efficient and come with tangible benefits to both audiences and the company.

Second, we are limiting headcount additions through a targeted hiring freeze. Hiring for the small subset of the most critical, business-driving positions will continue, but all other roles are on hold. Your segment leaders and HR teams have more specific details on how this will apply to your teams.

Third, we are reviewing our SG&A costs and have determined that there is room for improved efficiency—as well as an opportunity to transform the organization to be more nimble. The taskforce will drive this work in partnership with segment teams to achieve both savings and organizational enhancements. As we work through this evaluation process, we will look at every avenue of operations and labor to find savings, and we do anticipate some staff reductions as part of this review. In the immediate term, business travel should now be limited to essential trips only. In-person work sessions or offsites requiring travel will need advance approval and review from a member of your executive team (i.e., direct report of the segment chairman or corporate executive officer). As much as possible, these meetings should be conducted virtually. Attendance at conferences and other external events will also be restricted and require approvals from a member of your executive team.

Our transformation is designed to ensure we thrive not just today, but well into the future—and you will hear more from our taskforce in the weeks and months ahead.

I am fully aware this will be a difficult process for many of you and your teams. We are going to have to make tough and uncomfortable decisions. But that is just what leadership requires, and I thank you in advance for stepping up during this important time. Our company has weathered many challenges during our 100-year history, and I have no doubt we will achieve our goals and create a more nimble company better suited to the environment of tomorrow.

Thank you again for your leadership.

Any experience or thoughts on Start Engine?,16,ysr2fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ysr2fs/any_experience_or_thoughts_on_start_engine/,12,1668210719.0,"From what I've gathered Start Engine is like a Kickstarter for startups. You buy a small share of the startup and if they go public, you have the opportunity to make a return on your investment.

I am creating a program that attempts to mirror the bollinger bands that are calculated by Interactive Brokers. I get live data straight from IBKR and it comes in the form of 5 second ""bars"" with close, open, high, and low attributes. My current strategy when it comes to mirroring these bollinger bands is every minute appending the last close price to a list and calculating the bb bands from there. This price list is duplicated every 10 seconds and the most recent close price is appended to it, allowing the bb bands to be updated in an attempt to match IBKR's seemingly random re-calculation strategy looking at the live chart. This works in practice but the values outputted by my program are usually inconsistent by a few cents every time. Sometimes it works but most of the time its a little bit off. I guess a more general question would be how often do you think IBKR updates their indicators on a tick by tick level? I would appreciate any help as this bug sucks. Thanks!",2022-11-11 21:21:44

So I want to.throw $10k in VTI and figure I'll do it in 4 installments especially in that we've rallied quite a bit so far.

So today I threw in $2500 with a 5% trailing stop but maybe that's dumb?

The reason is that I kind of WANT it to fall maybe that much and then throw in another $2500 next week.

So I'm basically adding on down days.

I realize with $10k it doesn't matter much but to me even an extra $50 is something just for the idea of it.

So maybe I should just remove the stop?

I'm not much of a stop guy. I think they're kind of dumb since markets usually recover and if things like VTI fall 5% I should be thinking of ADDING not selling!

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Is there any advantage to dividends?,26,ys214h,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ys214h/is_there_any_advantage_to_dividends/,147,1668144024.0,"My friend and I are constantly arguing about this and it's clear that one of us is not getting it.

He is a big fan of dividend paying stocks. He will not buy stocks that don't pay dividends ""because with dividends, you get something back, cash in your hand, and you can reinvest it and buy more shares. Otherwise, I just have the same number of shares and if the stock goes down and I need to sell for income I'm screwed"".

This makes little sense to me. OK, great, it's his preference to buy divi stocks and there's nothing *wrong* with that but in the end, how is that any different from other stocks? Every time a dividend is paid out, the stock price declines by that much anyway. At the end of the day, you end up with the same amount of money bc a dividend paying stock doesn't go up as much as if they didn't pay out the dividend. In fact, getting a dividend means more trouble as you then have to buy more shares again and you have to pay for those transactions.

I just don't get his fascination with it. The only real deciding factor should be company performance. Dividends don't mean much if the stock is going down. You're still losing overall value.

Way I look at it is this, assuming two companies performing identically:

Company A (with divi): Keep reinvesting dividends until you retire. At that point, you have more shares and can live off your dividends, but the stock doesn't go up very quickly if at all.

Company B (no divi): Watch it grow and bc it's not paying dividends, the stock price will be much higher. Yes, you will have to sell shares for income when you retire but that's not fundamentally different from taking dividends.

He hates the idea of ""having to sell shares for income if the stock goes down"", but I just can't see how that's any different from taking a divi when the shares are down.",2022-11-11 07:20:24

Day After The Stock Market Bottom from the 2009 Low

By Kejal Vyas and Rob Curran
March 10, 2009 7:25 pm ET


Hope that fortunes may be turning for troubled banks and that regulators are moving aggressively to address disruptions in the markets that helped drive a broad stock rally on Tuesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 379.44 points, or 5.8%, to 6926.49, closing at its high for the day and recording its biggest point and percentage gains since late November.

The S&P 500-stock index surged 43.07 points, or 6.4%, to end at 719.60 as its financial sector gained 15%. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 89.64 points, or 7.1%, to 1358.28. Tech stocks snapped back from a sharp selloff on Monday that pushed stock indexes to fresh bear-market lows.


More than nine in every ten stocks on the New York Stock Exchange climbed. All 30 Dow components rose. General Electric GE 2.68%increase; green up pointing triangle climbed 20%, undoing some of the damage from a rout that has pushed its shares down by more than 45% this year. Alcoa AA 7.74%increase; green up pointing triangle and General Motors GM 4.41%increase; green up pointing triangle rose 13% each. Both have declined more than 40% so far in 2009 even after Tuesday's surge.

Short sellers may have rushed into the market to cover bets on Tuesday as the rally gathered steam. ""On a day like today, when this thing gets some legs, the sellers decide to back off and the shorts start to get nervous, and you find yourself with a big fat move,"" Mr. Charlop said.

Stocks rose sharply at the open and never wavered. The rally flushed investors out of safe-haven bets on Treasurys, gold and the dollar. The yield on the 10-year note briefly pushed above 3% while the two-year note's yield topped 1%. Gold futures slid under $900 an ounce.

This kind of broad-based move is encouraging, but the question becomes will it be sustained? At this point, it certainly feels that way,"" said Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. Similar sharp stock-market rallies in September, October and November turned out to be fleeting. The market has still not had two consecutive sessions of gains since Feb. 5 and Feb. 6.&nbsp;And all three major indexes are still more than 50% below their October 2007 peaks.",2022-11-11 05:11:45

Twitter's new owner Elon Musk, who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and U.S. defense contractor SpaceX, told employees of the social media business on Thursday that he recently sold shares of Tesla to ""save Twitter.""

He made the remarks during an all-hands meeting that he hosted in part to motivate Twitter employees who remain after sweeping layoffs to work hard. Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.

Earlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.

Musk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.

 

Among other things, [Musk wants Twitter to generate half of its revenue from Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/read-elon-musks-first-email-to-all-twitter-employees.html), and to become less reliant on advertising revenue.

Musk’s Twitter distraction has shaken some of Tesla’s most stalwart bulls. For example, [CNBC Pro reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/wedbush-removes-tesla-from-its-top-stocks-list-says-twitter-deal-an-albatross.html), Wedbush Securities has removed Tesla from its top stock list.

https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/data/consumerpriceindexhistorical_us_table.htm

The estimated MoM Aggregate Goods Index Price increase would be 1.631 (Oct 298.439 - Sept 296.808).

The actual MoM Aggregate Goods Index Price increase is 1.204 (Oct 298.012 - Sept 296.808)

When viewing previous “actual” MoM index numbers in the table above, the indices #s have been going down or relatively flat sincethe May to June spike:

May = 292.296
June = 296.311 (Increase)
July = 296.276 (Decrease)
August = 296.171 (Decrease)
September = 296.808 (Increase)
October = 298.012 (Increase)

Then we spike again from September to October.

Edit: TLDR/Discussion: It appears that there was a relatively dramatic increase in the CPI month over month from Sept-Oct (296.808 to 298.013) compared to previous month’s flatlining or decreasing. How does this result in a positive inflation outlook? And does the “estimate” of CPI 298.439 even matter?",2022-11-11 00:41:24

""I would rather move a little bit higher and have to come back then to move a little bit less high and to then tell people we're going to go higher, because at some point it does seep into inflation expectations,"" Daly said in a virtual appearance before the European Economics & Financial Centre

At the same time, she said, ""I don't want to be over tightening to the point where we throw the economy into a sharp recession, but if we are talking about a rate hike on either side, I want to fully get inflation sustainably down to 2% on average.""

In September, she said, she had penciled in a top fed funds rate next year of about 4.9%, she said, higher than the median forecast of her colleagues. Given that inflation tends to lag most other economic data and in light of the various headwinds facing the U.S. economy including the slowdown in global growth, ""I support a more gradual approach of getting to it so we can be discovering the right rate as we go.""

# [Stock futures inch higher as investors watch midterm results, await inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/09/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures inched higher Thursday as investors awaited new inflation data and eyed U.S. election results.
*****
> Futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures added 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.2%.
*****
> It follows a day of losses with the Dow dropping 646.89 points, or 1.95%. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 shed nearly 2.5% and about 2.1%, respectively.
*****
> The declines came amid uncertainty stemming from U.S. midterm elections. The market had hoped Republicans would take sweeping control of the House of Representatives and the Senate on Tuesday – a situation that would create gridlock in Washington, D.C. Instead, key Senate races in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada remain tightly contested. Indeed, the Senate race between Raphael Warnock, the Democratic incumbent, and Herschel Walker will head to a December runoff.
*****
> Stocks’ suffering worsened late Wednesday after crypto exchange Binance said it’s backing out of plans to acquire its rival FTX. This dragged down the tech sector and pulled bitcoin’s price to lows last seen in 2020.
*****
> Lack of clarity around the election, as well as uncertainty around incoming October consumer price index data and corporate earnings reports were the drivers around the selloff, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at the Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
> “Those three things are leading to uncertainty,” he said. “And, as everyone knows, markets really don’t like uncertainty.”
*****
> October’s CPI report, due Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET, is the next focal point for investors. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect that headline CPI rose in October by 0.6% from September, or 7.9% over a year ago. It’s a key report for the Federal Reserve, which will meet again in mid-December.
*****
> Weekly jobless claims are also due out on Thursday morning.

It takes 9-12 months for rate hikes to be felt and 12-18 months for the maximum effect.

I already knew that if you sell before the full 5 year, the last quarter basically doesn’t count so it really 9.5% over 1.25 years or 7.5%sh for 1 year. After doing a little more research, I realized bonds are taxed at income rate not capital gains rate (never invested in bonds before). That brings the 7.5% down another third or so to 5%. This is still probably my best investment of the year considering all of my stocks are down, but I still think it’s strange that the American government taxes the bonds they sell to you at a higher rate than stocks of companies.",2022-11-10 15:18:23

Stock market news live updates: Stocks plummet after midterms as Wall Street turns eyes toward inflation data,10,yr8q8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yr8q8q/stock_market_news_live_updates_stocks_plummet/,17,1668066909.0,"Stocks plummeted Wednesday after three days of gains, as investors mulled over a mixed verdict from the midterm election results and highly anticipated inflation data looms on the docket.

&#x200B;

The S&P 500 (\^GSPC) shed over 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (\^DJI) fell by nearly 650 points, or roughly 2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) dragged down by almost 2.5%, or 260 points.

&#x200B;

Investors’ optimism during stocks' three-day rally was built on expectations that Republicans would gain ground and create gridlock in Washington. But the Republican red wave failed to materialize in the U.S. midterms. Democrats managed to flip a crucial Senate seat, with John Fetterman beating Mehmet Oz in the Pennsylvania race. As of late Wednesday, both House and Senate control remains in the balance.

&#x200B;

“Going back to 1951, a Democratic president with a Republican or split congress, the two most likely cases this election, has seen an average S&P 500 Index return of over 17% versus an overall average of just over 12%,” Barry Gilbert, asset allocation strategist at LPL Financial, wrote in a note.

&#x200B;

The final outcome of the midterm results may not be known for days or weeks, but Wall Street pros aren’t expecting a big move in markets.

&#x200B;

“We expect the impact of the election to tilt the market positive, partly because we’ll have it behind us,” Gilbert added. “As far as markets are concerned, the policy impact is likely to be small, and market participants will continue to be more focused on central bank policy and inflation.”

&#x200B;

To that point, investors will turn their attention to Thursday morning's inflation report, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for October. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect headline CPI at an annual rate of 7.9%, down from 8.2% the month before. Even if the report shows prices starting to moderate, core CPI remains far above the Fed’s comfort zone.

&#x200B;

“We are still far above that 2% target,” Rebecca Felton, RiverFront Investment Group senior market strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. “So, we don't believe that the Fed is going to ease up at any point in the near term. And so rates will stay higher for longer and inflationary pressures clearly are likely to stay higher for longer, too.”

&#x200B;

In corporate news on Wednesday, Meta Platforms (META) said the social media giant would cut more than 11,000 jobs, or about 13% of staff, as the company restructures to cope with the slumping digital ad market. Disney (DIS) posted weaker-than-expected fourth quarter earnings Tuesday, with the streaming business resulting in wider losses that offset strong performance at the theme parks. Disney stock shed more than 13%.

&#x200B;

Elsewhere in markets, the largest U.S. homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc.'s (DHI) reported fourth-quarter earnings that showed buyers canceled nearly a third of deals, the latest red flag for the housing market. Tesla stock also fell Wednesday following a filing that showed CEO Elon Musk sold 19.5 million shares from Nov. 4-8. The sale came after he bought Twitter for $44 billion.

&#x200B;

On the earnings front, Rivian (RIVN), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Bumble (BMBL) are among the companies set to report earnings Wednesday.

Selling some stocks for a loss and then DCA into index funds?,13,yr7ma3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yr7ma3/selling_some_stocks_for_a_loss_and_then_dca_into/,37,1668062635.0,"I’m sure a lot of people are stressed out about being down in a lot of stocks, such as META or PYPL etc. 

Does it make sense to just sell for a loss, and then allocate that money and DCA into index funds like SPY/VTI? The chances of index funds performing well in the long term seems way more predictable than individual stocks like META or PYPL. So what’s the point of holding onto losses in stocks that crashed so much? At this point, it seems like DCAing into SPY (selling for a loss first) has a much better chance of recovering my portfolio than holding onto those individual stocks  

And isn’t it better mentally to do that? Rather than holding individual stocks that just keeps tanking and tanking? Just transfer all your losses and DCA into SPY, and just forget about it, rather than keep freaking out all the time.",2022-11-10 08:43:55
Opinion: People are still underestimating Twitter's risk on TSLA,84,yr7abh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yr7abh/opinion_people_are_still_underestimating_twitters/,104,1668061420.0,"**Edit: right on cue. Musk warns of Twitter bankruptcy:** [https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-information-security-chief-kissner-decides-leave-2022-11-10/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-information-security-chief-kissner-decides-leave-2022-11-10/)

Ok, there's already a lot that has been said about how negative Twitter has been to TSLA. But I think people are still undestimating just how much worse it can get.

Tesla investors are definitely pissed at this deal. One, it drives Elon's focus away from Tesla. Two, it forced Elon to sell TSLA. Three, if Twitter can't shore up its cash flow, Elon will likely have to keep selling TSLA to fund Twitter.

**Elon's erratic behavior is showing more than ever**

I used to think that Elon would make Twitter better. Now I'm not sure. His erratic behavior is showing up more than ever.

He cut half of the engineering staff, realized Twitter needed some fired engineers, while trying to cram untested monetization features into production. He's flip flopping on ideas within hours.

His ideas are half baked. For example, plenty of people got verified as [Lebron James, Trump, Nintendo, Jesus, etc.](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23450289/twitter-impersonators-official-mario-musk-jesus-valve) The site is losing its credibility fast which will scare advertisers.

Users are also complaining about obvious bugs and issues. It's just the beginning.

Worse, people are seeing live how Elon builds products and it's probably scaring Tesla investors that this is how he does things: half baked ideas, empty promises, erratic.

**Twitter's debt repayment is huge and Elon will have to continue to sell TSLA to fund it**

Twitter's debt payments are around \~$1b/year according to some reports. Elon really needs Twitter to start turning the ship around fast and start becoming profitable. It looks like he's trying to throw anything at the wall to get Twitter to increase profits asap.

If advertisers continue to pull out, he's going to have continue to sell his TSLA shares.

He leveraged his Tesla shares to borrow to buy Twitter. If TSLA drops, he's going to have to provide more collateral or get margin called.

**Elon probably doesn't know how to run a social media company**

It's increasingly looking like Elon does not know how to run a social media company. For example, he's demanding changes based solely on his opinion instead of running A/B tests to quantify the change. As someone who ran a ton of A/B tests for a product similar to Twitter's, there can be a lot of unintended consequences when it comes to monetizations. IE. It looks like your change increased revenue by 3% but it drops total revenue by 5% after 2 months.

**tldr:** Musk desperately orders features in and out. Advertisers pull out or sit on the sidelines. Revenue falls. Musk tries even more desperate things. More advertisers leave. Musk needs to sell more TSLA to fund Twitter experiment.",2022-11-10 08:23:40
question about stock issuing,11,yr5wxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yr5wxz/question_about_stock_issuing/,7,1668056686.0,"I was curious about how it works when companies issue new stock, and I couldn't find a super clear answer online. 

Let's say i manage a company and own 50% of it worth $50. 50 shareholders own the other half in the form of 50 shares together worth $50 as well.

If I want to issue another 50 shares at $1 apiece, will these 50 come from my shares? 
Or will another 50 be created and sold, resulting in me now owning only 33% of the company, but still having $50 worth of a now $150 dollar company?

Feels like I'm missing something here, and I probably am.

What's propping SPY up?,25,yr57mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yr57mu/whats_propping_spy_up/,42,1668054361.0,"Hi,

With almost every stock hitting all-time-low, I wonder what's propping SPY up so far?

Let's take 13th Oct 2022 as the lowest so far @ $348. SPY is up 7.14% while the top 5 (worth 19% of SPY) is down 1.87%, the gap is 9%. So for the bottom 497 (503-6) stocks (81% weightage) to make up the missing 9%, they need to be collectively up by 11%.

Is my understanding of how SPY works and my math correct? If this is correct, which companies are gaining so much in the last 4 weeks (since 13th Oct 2022)?

Pardon me if I'm making a fool of myself if my understanding of the above is wrong, but that's how we learn! Thanks!

Amazon Becomes World’s First Public Company to Lose $1 Trillion in Market Value,1950,yqzgdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yqzgdk/amazon_becomes_worlds_first_public_company_to/,227,1668037702.0,"Amazon.com Inc. is the world’s first public company to lose a trillion dollars in market value as a combination of rising inflation, tightening monetary policies and disappointing earnings updates triggered a historic selloff in the stock this year. 

Shares in the e-commerce and cloud company fell 4.3% on Wednesday, pushing its market value to about $879 billion from a record close at $1.88 trillion on July 2021. Amazon and Microsoft Corp. were neck-and-neck in the race to breach the unwelcome milestone, with the Windows software maker close behind after having lost $889 billion from a November 2021 peak. 

While technology and growth stocks have been punished throughout the year, fears of a recession have further dampened sentiment in the sector. The top five US technology companies by revenue have seen nearly $4 trillion in market value evaporate this year.

The world’s largest online retailer has spent this year adjusting to a sharp slowdown in e-commerce growth as shoppers resumed pre-pandemic habits. Its shares have fallen almost 50% amid slowing sales, soaring costs and a jump in interest rates. Since the start of the year, co-founder Jeff Bezos has seen his fortune dwindle by about $83 billion to $109 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Last month, Amazon projected the slowest revenue growth for a holiday quarter in the company’s history as shoppers reduce their spending in the face of economic uncertainty.

How Brownfield Capital turned 100k into 30 million in the Big Short,6,yqxaqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yqxaqo/how_brownfield_capital_turned_100k_into_30/,7,1668032203.0,"Hey guys, I know a lot of people are big fans of The Big Short and are familiar with the fact that Charlie and Jamie turned 100k into 30 million. This is a ridiculously obscene level of return that seems unbelievable. However, it is completely real and this is how they did it.

So basically Charlie and Jamie found huge opportunities in leap options because of how they were priced on stocks with big events.

For example, capital one financial was a trade in which they netted around half a million dollars off of just 26k invested. Capital one was under investigation because of supposed fraud regarding mortgage loans. The investigation had tanked the stock since a big part of their business could be deemed fraudulent and may have to shut down. Charlie and Jamie did the analysis and decided that if Capital one was found not fraudulent then the stock was worth a good bit more than what it was trading at. You could have bought shares and made decent money but Charlie and Jamie bought leaps since they were pricing in the chance that the company was fraudulent and were thus extremely cheap. They took the risk and bought 26k of leap options which would likely expire worthless if the company was fraudulent. However, risking 26 k was worth it since if the company was not fraudulent then the options would be repriced like the decent business capital one was. They took a 26k bet and it paid off.

Events like fraud investigation are often binary: If the company is fraudulent, major parts of the business have to be reworked or shut down which destroys business value. If the company is not fraudulent, the business continues on without any real change in value. Options obviously cannot perfectly price a company as being both fraudulent and successful so they are left in some sort of gray area. Taking risks in this gray area is what Brownfield did and how it became successful.

Ultimately, they repeated this strategy many times. Not always just on matters of fraud but really any event that would cause a strong directional move in the share price off of one event.",2022-11-10 00:16:43

If it does print money sure I loose out on some profit but I would still make money. 

My dad suggested I do 3M instead because they have a higher dividend. And could possibly buy 200 shares and do 2 options.

*****
> Stock futures were slightly lower — following recent market gains — as results of the midterm elections provided no clear answers about who would control Congress yet.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123 points, or about 0.4%. S&P 500 futures shed 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.3%.
*****
> Stocks are coming off three-straight days of gains into the election, where Wall Street was expecting Republicans to gain ground and block any future tax and spending plans. The Dow climbed 333 points on Tuesday for its third-straight session of gaining more than 1%.
*****
> But control of Congress was not clear. NBC News was not yet projecting control of the House of Representatives with an NBC estimate suggesting Republicans could win 220 seats, which would be a narrow majority.
*****
> In one of the key races that could determine Senate control, Democrat John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the pivotal Senate seat in Pennsylvania, according to an NBC News projection. Oz had the backing of former President Donald Trump, whose endorsed candidates saw spotty levels of success across the country. Critical Senate races in Georgia and Nevada were unresolved.
*****
> “It looks like the strong Republican win that was anticipated yesterday did not happen, and that reduces the chance of the Congress and the Senate extremely lowering spending of the President,” said Bokeh Capital’s Kim Forrest.
*****
> While the election captivated market attention, investors may want to move on now as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down inflation, potentially tipping the economy into recession.
*****
> The political landscape “will fascinate the Washington chattering class, but for the markets, the focus will shift to whether a recession looms, whether the Fed will end its tightening this winter, and whether a truce and negotiations are possible in the Ukraine war,” wrote Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments.
*****

We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1, I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted.""

The company also stated that the company would now become “leaner and more efficient” by cutting spending and staff, and shift more resources to “a smaller number of high-priority3 growth areas,” including ads, AI, and the metaverse.

Dividends & Stock Valuations Question,8,yqbyxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yqbyxg/dividends_stock_valuations_question/,24,1667979623.0,"Okay. Everyone and their brother says that dividends don't matter, but I remain unconvinced.

Everyone says the value of a stock falls by precisely the same amount of the dividend. So if Company A has a stock worth $10, then a $1 dividend payout leaves the stock at $9, because that cash was removed from the company. 

But stock prices aren't determined by the actual assets the company holds. They're largely determined by our collective thoughts on the future. That's why there are many, many stocks that do not make any money at all, but have positive prices. The amount of cash on hand matters to an extent, but not to the extent that this hypothetical scenario suggests. 

Let's take Company B which has assets of $9 and liabilities of $1. The price is currently $9.  They announce that their earnings guidance is 100% higher than last year. Do we really think the price is going to stay at $9 because that's all the capital they have?

TLDR: since price is a mixture of opinion on earnings & balance sheet, then dividends reduce value only by the proportion of price determined by balance sheet. 

Idk I might be wrong tho.",2022-11-09 09:40:23

Why or why not buy Disney?,15,yq6bva,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yq6bva/why_or_why_not_buy_disney/,85,1667961650.0,"
   Greetings, all!  I’ve starting trading with some success, but I’ve been careful.  I think I’m attracted to value companies, because the economics make sense to me.

I’m having trouble understanding the benefit buying a company like Disney at $90 (after hours), which lacks a dividend and has a PE of 57.  I’m comparing it to stocks like Ford (4% dividend, PE of 6).  

I know there are many growth stocks like Disney, but none of them seem to have the intrinsic value to justify their prices:  I submit Google. Meta, Carvanna, AMD, NVIDIA, etc, etc, that just deflated when the next [sucker] chose not to buy the inflated asset.

I know I’m missing something, so I’m hoping all of you kind souls can educate me.  It *seems* Disney is oversold, but the rational part of me thinks the stock should be trading at $40.

I appreciate your sage advice and wisdom.",2022-11-09 04:40:50
Elon Musk sells 19.5 million Tesla shares worth almost $4 billion,2381,yq5y61,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yq5y61/elon_musk_sells_195_million_tesla_shares_worth/,357,1667960590.0,"Source: https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/elon-musk-sells-19-5-million-tesla-shares-worth-almost-4-billion/  
  
Tesla CEO Elon Musk is selling millions of Tesla shares again. The celebrity executive disposed of 19.5 million shares Tuesday, which is worth about $3.95 billion, according to three filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Musk did not take to Twitter to explain why he sold shares, but it’s possible the money will go towards his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform, which went through last month.

In April, Musk also sold around 9.6 million shares of Tesla stock, which at the time was worth $8.5 billion. Those shares were sold at around $885.42. Since then, Tesla has issued a three-for-one stock split, bringing the cost of each share down.

Musk sold shares Tuesday at an average price of $202.56 each.

Tesla is currently trading at $191.30 after hours.

Robinhood Collapses Following Difficulties of Savior FTX - Shares plummeted 15% as FTX was acquired to save it from collapsing,141,yq5b1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yq5b1g/robinhood_collapses_following_difficulties_of/,74,1667958803.0,"Robinhood Markets Inc. tumbled by the most in more than a year after Binance Holdings Ltd. agreed to acquire Sam Bankman-Fried’s troubled crypto exchange FTX.com, which had been considered a potential suitor for the trading platform. 

Shares of Robinhood plunged 19% Tuesday, their steepest decline since August 2021, after the founders of Binance and FTX.com announced that they have signed a non-binding letter of intent on the takeover to “help cover the liquidity crunch” at FTX.com. 

Investors may have soured on Robinhood after the announcement as FTX was said to have been exploring a possible acquisition of the company, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News in June. 

“While the knee-jerk reaction is negative amid Sam Bankman-Fried’s \~8% stake, Robinhood’s exposure to crypto is small as the business remains diversified,” Mizuho Securities USA analyst Dan Dolev wrote in a report. 

Coinbase Global Inc. tumbled 11% to a four-month low on concerns that the Binance-FTX deal puts a spotlight on the challenges facing the $1 trillion crypto industry. 

“The rapid fall from grace of a crypto exchange demonstrates how fickle the crypto industry could be,” Dolev wrote. “This is a red flag for Coinbase, where the vast majority of revenues are from trading crypto tokens with little diversification elsewhere.”

Other cryptocurrency-linked stocks slipped Tuesday as Bitcoin fell as much as 17% to touch the lowest since November 2020 amid investor jitters. MicroStrategy Inc. sank 21% and Riot Blockchain Inc. lost 7.3%, while Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. fell 5.1% and Silvergate Capital Corp. tumbled 23%.

Meaning most companies reporting earnings are doomed to drop in price after hours and the following day.

Take LCID as an example for this week. This evening 11/08/2022 after the market closed LCID earnings were released. They posted a less than great earnings last quarter. After hours, the stock price dips. What does this tell us? Well, you can look at some facts. This economic environment is heading toward a consensus of a recession. Meaning most 9-5 people collectively think a recession is coming. Posting good or bad earnings no longer guarantees stock will rise, in fact, it almost always means it will fall in this specific economic market. This brings us to my point about the inherent value of the company, this idea ties more to the macro effects of the economy on stock prices.

Earnings may in fact be a sentence to have negative stock movement. Pay close attention to what earnings are on the horizon. Things are going to be bumpy. None of this is financial advice.

Which companies are profiting from general inflation but are not affected by rising production cost?,4,ypymt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ypymt4/which_companies_are_profiting_from_general/,21,1667941883.0,"You read everywhere that profits are higher than ever although we are in (hyper)inflation.

Margins for a lot of companies are under pressure because of rising production cost. I'm sure there are also lot of companies that can raise there prices because of this inflation while there is little to no impact on their costs. Who are they?

&#x200B;

First of all I was looking at the banking sector. Their cost don't seem to be in line with the rates they are asking now. They propably have a lower sell rate of mortgages but their margins on all product will be higher.

Next to that there will be a some FMCG companies that have risen their prices a lot higher than they should.

Finally a company like airbnb. Hotel (and restaurant) prices keep raising while airbnb has no additional cost. Linked to that is that people are spending more on their holidays due to the inability to travel during covid.

What else am I missing?",2022-11-08 23:11:23

The last 2 weeks I have been cutting my cash on hand percentage from 75% to 50%. I do understand that the Federal Reserve is still hiking rates and in previous post, I have warned against speculating on a Pivot. However, I realized that most companies have significantly cut their guidance which allows the market to price in new certainties. Their warning on a demand slowdown should be a precursor to waning inflation. Furthermore, the market has enjoyed relative calmness to the turmoil in Large Cap tech stocks over the past month. This may be a sign that investors are beginning to accept that profits and revenue will be down and that these new slashed stock prices are reflective of their true value and therefore forming protection for further downside.

# [Stock futures nudge higher as Wall Street awaits U.S. midterm elections](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/07/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were slightly higher Tuesday following a winning day for markets as investors looked ahead to U.S. midterm elections.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 52 points, or 0.16%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.18%. Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.47%.
*****
> Shares of Lyft fell nearly 20% premarket while Take-Two Interactive and Tripadvisor slumped more than 18% each after reporting disappointing quarterly results.
*****
> The moves come after a day when all major indexes notched a second straight positive session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher by 423.78 points, or 1.31%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 gained 0.96%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.85%.
*****
> Investors are awaiting Tuesday’s midterm election results. They will determine which party controls Congress and steer future policy and spending. Market participants will watch whether Republicans take back the House of Representatives, the Senate or both.
*****
> “The financial market reaction to a Republican win should be muted, as the House outcome is already widely expected, and the Senate outcome makes less of a difference to policy outcomes if Republicans control the House,” Goldman Sachs’ Jan Hatzius wrote in a Monday note.
*****
> “A surprise Democratic win in the House and Senate would likely weigh on equities, as market participants might expect additional corporate tax increases,” Hatzius added.
*****
> Wall Street will also closely watch Thursday’s consumer price index report for the latest data on how much the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have tamed high inflation. This reading could also signal the central bank’s path forward – another hotter-than-anticipated report could embolden the Fed to raise rates aggressively in December.
*****
> Earnings season continues this week. On Tuesday, Lordstown Motors, Lucid Group, Walt Disney and AMC Entertainment all report their latest quarterly results.

Elon unpopularity and EVs,0,ypltft,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ypltft/elon_unpopularity_and_evs/,36,1667913160.0,"Thoughts on Elon and the EV subsidy

I hear many people here saying they’re not going to buy a Tesla because of Elon. You’re not alone. There are millions of progressives around the country who won’t want to either.

What I am curious about is what happens if Tesla becomes the only US EV you can buy (1) with the full subsidy (2) within a reasonable timeframe. Yes, others like the Bolt with ultium will have the subsidy too, but it’s highly likely that they won’t be able to meet demand…..

So what happens? Dealerships become thieves. Salesmen hint that $1000 puts you on the waitlist for this year—otherwise wait till 2024! Dealerships put on thousand of dollars of mandatory upgrades. Dealerships have a MSRP adjustment. And the price won’t be guaranteed on delivery. You go to buy one of the few non tesla full subsidy EVs and suddenly you’re facing thousands of dollars of fees.

I am truly, honest before the gods, sympathetic to people who are annoyed with Elon rn. I am too. But how much of a premium are these feelings worth? It is almost a guarantee that by the time the ^ situation I spelled out above plays out, (1) a standard 4680 model Y will have a $ per mile of range as cheap, or cheaper, than competition because it will receive the full IRA subsidy. 

I know everyone here is aware of the shitty state of the non tesla charging network. These stories will grow. I have a friend who bought the id4 that won’t road trip with it anymore. They are not alone. 

So hate Elon all you want. I don’t blame you. But let’s be honest… the tesla cost advantage is going to grow, and unless legacy seriously reforms the dealership system and third party charging reliability goes up significantly…then the cost of avoiding tesla for an EV *in the future* goes up a lot.",2022-11-08 15:12:40

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Nvidia to Sell New Chip in China It Says Meets US Export Ban,114,ypb6hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ypb6hu/nvidia_to_sell_new_chip_in_china_it_says_meets_us/,26,1667881944.0,"Nvidia Corp., the most valuable chipmaker in the US, has begun producing a processor for China that conforms to new rules aimed at limiting that country’s access to artificial-intelligence computing.

The A800 GPU, or graphics processing unit, went into production in the third quarter and serves as an alternative to the A100 model, Nvidia said in a statement Monday. “The A800 meets the US government’s clear test for reduced export control and cannot be programmed to exceed it,” the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said.

**Nvidia** **jarred investors** **earlier this year when it said that it was banned from selling the A100 and forthcoming H100 products to Chinese customers without special US government approval**. The change put hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue at risk. The US is concerned that the processors might be used by the military, Nvidia said in a regulatory filing in August.

The Biden administration expanded the restrictions last month, escalating tensions between the two countries and adding fresh hurdles for US chipmakers already facing a slump in demand. Nvidia has lost more than half its value this year, following three straight years of gains. 

Data centers rely on graphics chips like Nvidia’s to handle AI tasks and process huge sets of information. The US government’s rules on China exports place a cap on the speeds that such chips can communicate with each other, thereby limiting their usefulness.

Reuters previously reported that Nvidia had begun offering the A800.

like even if you do have faith in the company you stand to make a little money by selling now and then buying back once the value bottoms out, right? ig i don't see much point in holding on to your share at this point in time- esp if $tsla is just going to bounce back later.

"Cathie Wood's Latest Take on Future of EV Cars:""If Electric Vehicle Prices Continue Declining, ARK’s EV Forecast Could Be Too Conservative""",190,yoxs3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yoxs3o/cathie_woods_latest_take_on_future_of_ev_carsif/,140,1667849817.0," From ARK Invest's latest newsletter:  

*During our brainstorm on Friday, ARK discussed the possibility that our* ***already high-end EV forecast could be too low.*** *The chart is work-in-progress that offers some perspective on this topic (see source). The purple line depicts the price elasticity of demand for all cars, both gas-powered and electric: as prices drop, auto manufacturers can target a larger share of the market. According to the navy line, as the average price has declined during the last 10 years, EVs have increased their share of the global auto market.*

*According to Wright’s Law and ARK’s adoption model, as the cost to produce 300-mile range EVs continues to decline, their market share will approach \~67%, or 48 million units, in 2027, as depicted in the green line. This forecast incorporates a decline in total vehicle unit sales due to autonomous vehicles. The gap between the trajectory suggested by Wright’s Law in the green and the history of market share gains in the purple suggests that EVs are likely to capture a much higher share of the market than ARK has forecasted. Instead of 48 million units, EV sales would scale 8-fold from 8-9 million units this year to roughly 67 million in 2027!*

*That said, several forces could derail the 67-million-unit forecast. Perhaps because of materials shortages or technology issues, EV production will not be able to scale that quickly. Perhaps a severe decline in used car prices will pose more of a competitive threat than we anticipate.*

Comment,1,j0t0120,,0,1671424407.0,"Hybrids are actually bad for business from a profitability standpoint. I'd reckon Toyota's margins on them are quite low and one of the biggest reasons they sold well was that it qualified for government incentives offered to those who purchased an 'EV' which a hybrid plug-in technically qualified for. The other is bridging the gap in terms of car range but many people who own a Prius actually used gasoline more often than the electrical portion of the vehicle. Essentially, the vehicle was an ICE vehicle for the majority of the time it was driven. There was certainly a need for it because of battery range concerns but many base model EV's will have at least 200 miles range and with the $7.5k tax credit in America, it's going to be price-competitive with ICE vehicles.

capex and r&d are completely different things. if googl were to hire more staff (unlikely due to recession), you would expect r&d to increase. if however they're investing more in long-term assets, you would expect CapEx to increase which is why I mentioned it. CapEx does not effect ebit.

Regarding WACC, that's not something I would do personally because a heavily skewed discount factor does not accurately forecast the stock in the current environment. and imo, you are way too optimistic with forecasting revenue but again, we have different perspectives because we are two different individuals. the past 5 years have been incredibly favorable for high growth with low interest rates. you should not expect the next 5 years to repeat rev growth wise.",2022-12-19 06:19:27

Comment,5,j0syc4c,,0,1671423512.0,"Almost every legacy automaker have already pledged to go fully EV by 2035-2040. 

Some countries are outright banning ICE vehicle sales as soon as 2025.

EV's have come a long way and will continue to. With the $7,500 EV tax credit available in America, it would make very little sense to purchase an ICE vehicle in the upcoming years. 

I'm not sure where the low-range equation is coming from but that hasn't been true for quite some time. Many EV's have 200 miles, minimum, these days. The average person doesn't drive 200 miles per day (mostly 40 miles). The charging infrastructure is the biggest problem but for homeowners who own an EV, all they have to do is spend $1,000 for an EV charger in their home and it will charge 30 miles per hour. They'll never need to charge their vehicle unless they are going on a road trip.

Comment,2,j0suo3b,,0,1671421597.0,"I mostly agree. I use DCF models, but I think they're way over hyped. In my opinion most people use them wrong and even when they're used right they have too much uncertainty to be worth much.

If you're literally just taking the market risk free rate and plugging that into a DCF model along side market growth expectations you might as well not run a DCF model at all because the current stock price will probably be a far better approximation of current market expectations anyway.

And before someone says, ""but DCF models would have stopped you investing in overvalued companies in 2021"". That's mostly BS too.

It might have prevented you investing in some ""overvalued"" companies, but as I've explained in other comments this notion that 2021 was a bubble is mostly a rewriting of history. In 2021 the risk free rate was a little above 1% and many companies were growing at 20 - 50% YoY. If you start plugging those numbers into models you can justify 2021 prices quite easily. In fact, when I take 2021 market expectations and plug those into models the market seemed undervalued in 2021 for the most part.

And if you don't believe me go on YouTube and look for people doing DCF models of companies like TWLO or ADBE from 2021. And I'm not just talking idiots, actual professionals got it wrong too. Here's the ""dean of valuation"" telling you AMZN and META are undervalued at the start of the year, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3KqRoTN9nk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3KqRoTN9nk)

DCF models only really work if you're brave enough to opinionated and can price the direction of growth and yields better than the market can. But the truth is most of the time the market is right. And if you believe the market is normally right, then you can assume the price of the stock you're looking to buy is probably a fair reflection of market expectations. And therefore the idea you're going to generate alpha from plugging market expectations into a crappy DCF model you built in Google Sheets is close to absurd.",2022-12-19 05:46:37

Comment,1,j0st4ud,,0,1671420818.0,"Assume the current Flavour of the AI Month: ChatGPT.

With million of dollars of infrastructure it takes about 8 hours to train, and probably about 20 data engineers working for _months_ to create the underlying dataset.

Consider the training moment in time to be a... ""snapshot"" of reality at the time the AI was trained, it cannot comprehend anything that is information/context that came after this moment, it will also treat all reality based on its ""frozen in time"" perspective.

Then Elon Musk decides to play games with the markets on Twitter, or it turns out a group of banks was lying about the Rating of their mortgages, or some schmuck in the Bahamas is skimming money from everyone, or Putin  farts too close to the nuke button, or......

The time it takes to gather, ingest and prepare data, added to model training time, added to prediction time, means that any form of Neural Network style AI trading will limited to short term scalping or arbitrage, a field that is already dominated by Algos anyway.

What's going to progressively dissappear is the possibility to find alpha in the 5 minute bar (outside of black swan events) , but if you are trying to do that today you are in the wrong game anyway.

Buy and hold, trend trading, good macro trading... these are fields that are good grounds for retail now and in the future, because you are riding the coat tails of the big bois hoovering crumbs (and that A-OK) 

Event/News trading, Deep Analysis of Business Reports (especially to find bullshit), Cleverly hiding insider trading,  Industry/Sector trading and forecasting, geopolitical commodities trading, these are all good future fields for retail, as they are man-hour and expertise intensive, and big trading desks are gonna do the math someday and figure out the small drop in performance in focusing on automated short-term will be compensated by consistency and reduced labor cost.

Machine learning models can do a lot of things, but machine learning models need to be trained on data. There isn't a way to get a dataset that would track all of the relevant features to perfectly predict stock price movements (you would need real time access to private investment fund positioning, unreleased economic data, OTC trades, dark pools, etc.). Just training autoregressive models on historical stock prices themselves won't work - people have already been doing that for decades.

Stock trading is also an adversarial environment, which increases the difficulty by a lot (i.e. even if your model is right most of the time, the minority of times when it is wrong will get heavily exploited, limiting your ability to profit). 

That said, in 30 years my comment could be completely wrong if there's an entirely new paradigm of AI that uses a completely different approach from today's methods.

If you look at post dot com bubble, a lot of tech and more growth oriented names survived. But there was significant valuation suppression and resulted in a lot of names taking the better part of a decade to recover.

If you’re someone who is looking at a simple chart and saying “well the stock was at 100 dollars a share, and it’s now at 50, it’s bound to come back” will it really though? A lot of companies over the last several years had no business being anywhere close to the valuations they were trading at. They may never go back to those levels and if they do, it may take a LONG time.



At the end of the day, when you are investing in a stock, you are buying a business.

Higher Risk Free rate of return = bad for long duration equities. These are growth oriented companies, that prices are based on future cash flows rather than current. 

We have had an era where growth oriented assets (think nasdaq, tech stocks, etc.) dominated. We are now shifting into an era where rates may be higher and monetary policy more restrictive. If this is the case shorter duration equities (think value stocks) could out perform.

I think a lot of folks who are “buying the dip” but choosing to just buy assets like tech stocks are going to be in for a surprise when they lag for the next ten years.





History doesn’t repeat itself but it usually rhymes. Look at an asset quilt chart look at asset class performance going back to the 80s.

You should not be discounting your entire model with the peak terminal rate because by any projection, this 5% terminal rate will be a temporary thing.

Risk-free rates in DCFs are supposed to be the return on zero-coupon bonds *without reinvestment risk*. Meaning without the risk that you have to reinvest at a lower rate in the future. So a projected drop in interest rate in 2-3 years must also be taken into account when discounting cash flows further out into the future. 

Standard practice (im going off of Damodarans writings) says you could work with individual discount rates to discount future years. So only 1-3 years of cash flow will be ""marked down"" somewhat by this rise in rates, assuming we go back to 2-3% in a couple of years. The bulk of value usually comes from further out (and especially your terminal value) which will be less affected.


The real risk in value lies in diminished growth, costlier reinvestment and for some companies, complete inability to service or roll debt",2022-12-19 03:40:38

Comment,25,j0sevt7,,0,1671413842.0,"Interest rates act like gravity to equity valuations. Higher interest rates, stronger pull downward on stock prices. They are relative to one another (and everything else), but interest rates are one of the most compelling factors in market perception of equity value. This is why there is so much hand-wringing around FOMC meetings.

CAPM might have some use for day traders, but it's little more than financial astrology. What it incorporates (including ""Beta"") is bullshit in terms of finding the value of a business. I want high volatility. That's the only way I'm ever going to be able to buy an equity at far less than it's worth. But according to financial astrology, high volatility is a bad thing.

P/E, crude as it is, is just a yield inverted. So suppose the 10yr treasury climbs up to 5%. Relative to a 20 P/E stock - a 5% yield - what would you rather own? A note guaranteed from the US Treasury to pay 5%, or a stock promising 5%? Anybody with a functional brain takes the Treasury, 10 times out of 10. So then investors tack on a ""risk premium"" to the stock - a demand of additional return in order to own the less certain of the two. Maybe 3%. So now the stock has to offer 8% return to compete with the 5% Treasury. A stock offering 8% is 100/8 = a P/E of 12.5. This is accomplished by a reduction of the numerator (price) in the P/E ratio from 20 to 12.5. The stocks price took a roughly 40% haircut.

You're going to find infinitely better advice much faster. Secondly, short term ""investments"" are generally called trading. If you're clueless, don't trade. 90% of the investors in average lose when trading and 99.9% of NEW investors lose at first. It's a very dangerous time to be investing right now. If it were 2 years ago, I'd tell you to think of three random letter, flip a coin, if you get heads, invest 20% of your savings in that 3 letter stock. Do that 5 times and forget about it for a few years. Right now, even experts are bleeding, not because we're in a bear market but because of uncertainty.

What matters more is what interest rates will be in the future.  There is ample evidence the increase in rates is due to efforts to strengthen USD hegemony and have essentially nothing to do with domestic factors, outside of the necessity of importing manufactured goods and certain raw materials.

You can’t compare a hotel to a vacation rental. They never meant to be the same experience so don’t expect the same rules. Go stay in a hotel if that’s what tickles your Fanny.

In a hotel the most you do is bring in shopping bags or some food which you put in the trash and your room service will normally take it out. Your hotel room also doesn’t host groups of 8-12 people on the regular. The amount of trash 12 people produce vs a room for 2, is t equivalent. 

Even before Airbnb days, when you rented a house you were required to take out your trash and wash your dishes. This is unsanitary and perhaps the maid service won’t arrive a day after you leave. Cleaning the home has nothing to do with trash disposal or dish washing. These are basic things that you should be doing without the host asking.",2022-12-19 01:40:07

A 30-year mortgage mortgage at 3% (before) is a lot more enticing than a mortgage at 7% (now). This also effects refinancing and HELOC's.

Comment,9,j0rpasz,,0,1671402418.0,"Most of the comments in here are towards how AirBnB is a dying business, so I will offer a few counter points in favor of them. I haven’t used a hotel for probably 7-8 years now (for work it’s still hotel stay) and probably use AirBnB 4-5 times a year (although sometimes it’s just a weekend, sometimes longer) Here are the reasons

1. I don’t want to eat out every single meal, even if I am on vacation. One gets tired of the same greasy/ fried fast food options quickly. When I go in larger groups with family, there is not a lot of energy left after being out all day on vacation, so it’s actually nice to cook together and enjoy a game of cards or whatever instead of everyone dining out and going to one’s separate rooms. 
2. I have a 2 year old and a pet. And not a lot of hotels are friendly to 2 year olds and pets whereas many AirBNB are. 
3. I want to enjoy the localities in new towns when I go there and experience neighborhoods. The cookie cutter experience of staying at a Marriott/ 4 seasons/ other hotels no matter where you go, to me personally is very boring. I have stayed in homes featured in Architectural magazines, in cool neighborhoods, which I wouldn’t have gotten a chance to without AirBnB


I am long AirBNB and I would be surprised if they don’t come out a massive winner in this segment in next 10 years. Usually, the legislations and recessions in businesses help the biggest brand consolidate their position, not work against them. So I believe OP’s high end case of closer to $200 in 5 years time is actually pretty reasonable. Great DD have to say.",2022-12-19 00:26:58

They don't notice how much lifting those reinvested dividends are doing. Especially when you get into the cycle of buying more shares that pay you more that buy you more. It's your salary for owning the business and the easiest way to live off your investments.

Assuming the market believes that margins will continue to normalize around the 10% average, when the company is at 5% margins you will likely get a 2% FCF yield making it look expensive when the company is at 15% margins you will likely get a 6% FCF making it look cheap.

You don't 'sell it' if you hold it to maturity. If the principal is say $100 and interest rate is 5%, a one year bond would payout $5 in interest. But a 3 month note therefore pays 5/4 = $1.25 in interest. The interest payments are determined by whatever the coupon payouts are (fixed in advance) relative to the price. 

After 3 months, you get your $100 back and $1.25 in interest, in this example. 

If you sell it prematurely, then you would only get any coupon payments made up to the selling point and may end up selling it at a price lower/above what you paid.

A stop-loss order is an order placed with a broker to sell a specific stock once the stock falls a certain price. A stop-loss is designed to limit an investor's loss on a security position. For example, setting a stop-loss order for 5% below the price at which you bought the stock will limit your loss to only 5% of you initial investment. Suppose you just purchased Microsoft (MSFT) at $320 per share. Right after buying the stock, you enter a stop-loss order for $318.

However, shitty guests do make it worse for others which is why checkout rules are getting ridiculous with some hosts.

**Edit**: 

*You don’t bring in cases of beer, catering, or groceries which you prep, cook and dispose of when you are in a hotel. In a hotel the most you do is bring in shopping bags or some food which you put in the trash and your room service will normally take it out. Your hotel room also doesn’t host groups of 8-12 people on the regular. The amount of trash 12 people produce vs a room for 2, isnt equivalent. 

Even before Airbnb days, when you rented a house you were required to take out your trash and wash your dishes. This is unsanitary and perhaps the maid service won’t arrive a day after you leave. Cleaning the home has nothing to do with trash disposal or dish washing. These are basic things that you should be doing without the host asking*

Hotels and airbnbs aren’t meant to be the same. Vacation rentals always had rules to them. Don’t blame this on Airbnb or the home owner. Again, I repeat — hotels and homes aren’t the same.

Comment,24,j0r6pw0,,0,1671394859.0,"I’ve found this to be true In 90% of my trips. 

Very anecdotal obviously but my main memorable airbnbs have been:

1. On the Oregon coast. A very tiny oceanfront duplex where the owner lived on the other side. The tiniest kitchen I’ve ever seen with very little cabinet space so we were basically sharing plates, cups, and bowls as a family. Lots of rules. We had to do a lot of cleaning before we left to avoid a fee. We’ve decided against airbnbs on the coast because of this place. The comparable hotel rooms are similar cost but bigger in size, better beach access, and shared amenities like hot tubs. If you need anything it doesn’t feel as weird to bug the front desk. 

2. “Dome house” in the woods. We did a little staycation out of the city only a 30 minute drive away. This one was a very positive Airbnb experience for me because of its uniqueness. The house was huge, with very tall ceilings, and 100% ours for the weekend with no host on site. It had a huge hot tub and we saw deer walk up to the house in the mornings. The wifi crapped out, and we were limited in the amount of trash we could throw away for some reason, but we made the best of it. 

3. I went to California for a quick funeral a few weeks ago and stayed at an Airbnb for the night. I had never done the thing where you get a room in a house with the hosts. Hard pass on ever doing this again. The hosts were in their early 20s and in the sink of the shared bathroom was a bunch of their nail trimmings. The house was otherwise fairly clean(they probably use a house cleaning service) but it felt like being in college again with roommates because I generally didn’t feel comfortable taking up the living room or other shared spaces. There was also no tv in my room so I kinda just kept to myself holed up in my room looking at my phone. Weird..

So if you can find a very unique Airbnb, with a whole place to yourself, I’d do it, but otherwise I’ll tend to prefer a hotel.",2022-12-18 22:20:59

Comment,1,j0r5ah0,,0,1671394310.0,"Please take a look at the 10 year chart and tell me what you think. Triple leveraged funds haven’t been around long term which is why you can’t tell. I know exactly how it works. I’ve had it for a while. It does bleed due to volatility but not nearly as bad as you think. And if it slowly goes up, you will make plenty of money. Yes, it’s not “meant” for long term holds. But you do the minimum and understand funds, they have disclaimers so they aren’t liable if people lose money. 

If you lump sum invested at the peak a year ago, yes, it would take a while to recover. But if you DCA over a long period of time, you will likely make a ton. I’m not saying it’s not dangerous. I’m not saying it’s not risky. But it’s much less risky than you are portraying.

Again, look at the 10 year chart. Look at the 5 year chart. 

Now, with the market being down so much, is a great entry point.

Comment,0,j0r4z0t,,0,1671394184.0,"OP, if you are reading this, take my genuine advise and learn to make a decision for yourself. Opinions here are mostly garbage. I hold 11.4k tqqq shares and i’ll tell you why. 

1. Volatility decay is a garbage reason to not hold and invest in tqqq. Dca solves this problem so long as the % you put in is proportionate to your holding size. Also, volatility is good if you’re looking to purchase the shares at lower prices, if it ain’t obvious enough. 

2. Prospectus is meant to be a disclaimer, not an advise. When someone says shit is safe for human to eat, doesnt mean you should eat it. Same thing - 3x leverage is not meant for everyone, but doesnt mean it is not suitable for you. I see low prices as bargains, and 3x leverage gives me such opportunities faster. 

3. Core beliefs. I believe that one should never go against an index such as SPY and QQQ. Some may have been capable of spotting teslas etc, but if that’s not you, index etf is the way to go. 

4. Add leverage to core beliefs. 8% returns are stupid. To get higher returns, you’ll need to balance in terms of leverage (to margin, do options or simply buy leveraged products, u decide on ur own)

I believe in TQQQ is because all I need is one long, expansionary bull run to make my bucks. Anyone can label me anything, i don’t care. I think TQQQ should give me disgusting returns and all i gotta do is to be able to withstand 80% drawdowns and be patient in the future.

Comment,3,j0r4n8k,,0,1671394058.0,"I like to think about the concept of video phones sometimes. 

The tech to make a video phone has been around since the 80s. It certainly would have been possible to outfit everyone’s houses with video phones and even retro-future media at the time like Back To The Future II assumed video phones would be a thing.

But they basically weren’t. Even today in 2022 people use video calling and conferencing kind of sparingly. Every call from one iPhone to another one today could be a FaceTime call but very few of them actually are. Not that it’s not a nice or useful feature under the right circumstances, but it’s not a killer app because most people prefer not to be on video on the phone. No amount of tech is going to change that.

I wonder if the Metaverse is a similar kind of thing, where even if the tech did exist most people wouldn’t bother adopting. It doesn’t really solve a problem anyone has, and it’s not entertaining enough to be an entertainment venue. Maybe there might be some niche applications here and there, but no one really wants to live in “ready player one” and that’s just kind of how it is.

The key was Amazon would dangle that benefits carrot in front of you and encourage you to rat out fellow workers for any little thing that could get them fired because come 90 days, only a handful of people were gonna keep their jobs.  Mass firings began day 85, I made it to day 88.  My roommate actually made it & worked his 5yrs.  The Amazon crew would party at our house every night to drink away their hatred of Amazon.

So I would spend a little time researching that because currently you would be able to buy the stock at near it's 5 year low.

If you DCA'd $100/month during that period, you'd have $40,717

If you lump summed those contributions in 1997, you'd have $68,581

The difference is because the lump sum secured a lower average cost basis, but also the maximum available dividends for the entire period. Not that SPY has much of a dividend, but over 16 years it adds up.",2022-12-18 21:01:38

Basically, if they actually want people to use it they need to make it a lot easier AND give people a reason to use it.

Comment,1,j0qnzta,,0,1671387777.0,"Apple makes chips for their own products, they don't make server chips for third parties.  They are ~10% of the PC market.  The M chips aren't anything that special, they trade blows on a couple benchmarks but get obliterated in others and you can't game on them.  OEMs won't ever make their own chips, they don't have the kind of cash Apple has and never will.  OEMs have the vast majority of market share.

From Google's own site about their TPU: ""Cloud TPUs are optimized for specific workloads. In some situations, you might want to use GPUs or CPUs on Compute Engine instances to run your machine learning workloads.""

https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tpus

So even they admit their TPU isn't right for every workload.  There is a reason Google, Microsoft and Meta keep making huge deals with AMD.  They know they can't do everything themselves.

Like I said, even if in house design gains market share, the pie for semiconductor demand is huge and growing.  Graviton, TPUs and Apple chips make up an incredibly small slice of the overall market right now.  Looks like it might be growing now but it's hard to say.  They can't compete with AMD on performance per watt at the high end, especially when their 128 core Bergamo comes out.  We don't know if Amazon even saved money by deploying Graviton.  Either way, there will always be demand for neutral hardware vendors, nobody wants to be locked into Google Cloud, AWS or Azure etc forever.",2022-12-18 20:22:57

Comment,1,j0qn4hu,,0,1671387486.0,"I'm late to this conversation but wanted to say that I agree - most ETFs are not a good value. Example: I bought VIG in Mar 2022 and am still underwater on it. A big loss. Yes, that could have happened even if I'd bought a stock on the same day. But stock losses are easier to anticipate then ETF losses if one reads a stocks' annual reports, quarterly earnings statements, and pays attention to the way the stock behaves (technicals, highs, lows, volume, news releases, etc.). I hold over 60 equities and bonds and only one ETF (XLE). Almost all of my equities pay dividends and I'm content to keep following my own strategy vs. buying VIG and taking a loss. I had expected VIG to perform better than my own strategy - and I've been disappointed. XLE provided good returns for a long time but I'm selling out before it hits bottom. 

We all have to find our own way of investing, I've been doing it for a very long time, and I'd rather buy & follow stocks, bonds, and preferred stocks that are somewhat transparent than own ETFs or Mutual Funds which are opaque. I enjoy getting dividends and own quite a few growth stocks but they seem to be stalled - I expect the tight money supply and higher interest rates will impede their growth.

I’m a software engineer, what I’ve mostly seen, personally, is:
- Excessive communication overhead, too many cooks in the kitchen making decisions 
- Bad ideas getting prioritized (both bad product ideas, and lots of time fixing areas of tech debt that don’t actually have a large productivity impact)
- Codebase is too slow to modify safely (slow compilation, not enough automated tests, spaghetti code, etc.)

Spoiler: it’s not. 

What do you use to screen stocks? Do you know the basics of checking p/e p/b p/fcf etc.? 

If you didn’t know, you can check all of that on Finviz for free. If you register, you can get nearly all of the screeners you need in order to vet the stocks you see online. It’ll try to get you to sign up when you view the income statements, but you can get all those on the Nasdaq site for no charge. 

Check out r/bogleheads and r/valueinvesting as well.

Bogleheads is a good place to start. The premise and tldr is that the vast majority of investors won’t beat an index fund over the long run, so unless you’re incredibly lucky or just awesome and patient, you’re better off with a low cost ETF. 

Bogle and Buffet, basically the patron saints of investing agree on that.

also your wacc looks way too low. with a rfr of 3.5%, id expect a much higher wacc

anyway, your revenue growth rates are wayyy too high for me, especially since we're going into a declining future. as with all companies, the larger you get, the harder it gets to grow. when i evaluate future revenue, i always do declining just because of the uncertainty of the future. but that's the beauty of dcf, everyone has their own inputs. imo you should create cases: bear, base, bull so whoever uses your analysis can appropriately judge the scenarios. best of luck",2022-12-18 19:08:46

Had I kept that money, and invested it in a stock like AAPL, it would have turned into over $14,000,000.00.

I mention this because years later I put some 15,000 into AAPL and it turned into 200K.

So don't despair.  Invest in good companies, (preferably after the collapse), and you'll probably be OK.

EDIT: (Yeah, I know I talk about AAPL a lot, because it's a company I know and follow, so it's a good way to learn and earn form market movements.)",2022-12-18 18:46:22

Comment,0,j0q6hc7,,0,1671381203.0,"It has nothing to do with ""capitalism."" Example: people build a bunch of factories and then a once-in-a-100-years storm destroys it all. It doesn't matter why the factories were built, whether it was from private investment or government direction. A lot of resources were wasted and now production will be lower and more resources have to be spend to rebuild.

The recessions / depressions are caused when malinvestment and/or over consumption of resources happens based on incorrect assumptions in the future that end up being wrong - like thinking the factories wouldn't be destroyed. Or investing in one thing that ends up not being profitable.

Productive economies require planning years into the future. But its hard enough for individual experts in any industry to predict things years in the future, let alone centralized governments or banks who have only generalized knowledge!

No.   Stocks are not bonds; dividends are not fixed like bond coupons are.  Interest rate increases are generally co-incident with inflation increases.  If prices rise across the board, then companies should be able to increase their profits to match the price increases.  This will allow them the increase dividends by a corresponding amount.

If investors believe that a companies dividend will increase with inflation, they will not bid down the price.  One of the best examples of this is Pepsi; they have been able to push price hikes and keep their margins steady, so they should be able to raise dividends at least in line with inflation, and probably a little more.  Because of this, their price is actually up for the year, as opposed to a 20% drop in long bond prices.",2022-12-18 18:29:42

Comment,2,j0q48v3,,0,1671380293.0,"You are missing other facts:

\- income flows from dividends are much more stable over time than stock prices.  Blue chip stocks rarely cut dividends, and usually raise them at least at the rate of inflation over the long term, so they will tend to produce a reliable inflation protected income stream for an investor, which is generally an investor's biggest goal. 

\- income from dividends is not subject to an open auction market.  If you want to get money from selling a stock, there needs to be a market participant willing to pay you for that stock.  In market downturns, those buyers will reduce their offer prices significantly, so you will be forced to accept much less money for your stock.  With a dividend paying stock, the dividends will generally produce an increasing flow of income over time

\- distributing money as dividends will tend to optimize a company's capital allocation, and give them a better return on equity, meaning it should improve their total return over time

\- the prospect of a consistent dividend will tend to put a floor on a stock price.  If a company's stock price drops, its dividend yield will increase.  At a certain point, that dividend yield will attract buyers.  This buying will limit the amount that the stock price drops",2022-12-18 18:18:13

Comment,1,j0q1blu,,0,1671379126.0,"I’ve had tons of success both with dividend investing and with capital appreciation. 

Think of it two ways. Whichever one’s feels more right to you. Will probably be better for you.

1st. Capital appreciation. Your buying companies and hope they go up.  Every company starts out small.  Some become big.  You really only need a few home runs in order to be good.  You will have many duds.  Books to read.  I would suggest. One up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch.  How to make money in stocks by Matt Galgiani.

2.  Dividend investing. Not talking about yield chasing. But dividend investing. Think of it more as owning business.  Your now a business owner.  You save money. You buy a company. They send you a scheduled check every so often when they make money.  You want it to increase over time. For books,  I’d suggest warren buffets writings.  Plus looking at his actual holdings. You won’t see him buy something with a 10% yield.  Perfectly fine seeing something with a yield under 2% and waiting for it to grow.",2022-12-18 17:58:46
Comment,1,j0q17nj,,0,1671379083.0,"Absolutely not.

Cisco is still 30% below ATH in 2000. On top of that, they've gone from the 4th biggest company in the world by market cap to only being less than 10% of the largest market cap company. Yet despite all that, if you'd have been 100% Cisco in 2000 with a $100,000 portfolio, and invested only $200 more into Cisco every month, you'd now be up well over 100% since 2000.

Versus being patient in low-cost ETFs and index funds which have an almost 100 year track record of returning 10% compounded returns. So retail day-trade and maybe you’re in the 5% that earn big money quickly (and are smart enough to cash out), or be patient over a 20-30 yr period and have a 99% chance to be wealthy.",2022-12-18 17:38:27

Comment,1,j0px8l3,,0,1671377445.0,"How do you define 'long run', though? Most people use it for an investment horizon over 10 years. We're talking about a 5 year investment horizon here.

I do not have the numbers to hand, but there have certainly been times when index investors have been down 5 years or more. During the Great Depression, it was probably over 10 years (note that the index took about 25 years to recover it's price, however in terms of total return it was much quicker, but I think still over 10 years).

As an aside, governments do default on their loans sometimes. Especially if they are denominated in a foreign currency, or a currency which they can't print. If denominated in their own currency, then most of the time they would print their way out, but while that satisfies their obligations to creditors, it also destroys the currency. So sometimes even then, default is preferable.",2022-12-18 17:30:45
