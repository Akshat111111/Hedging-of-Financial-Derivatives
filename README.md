## Example Strategy 📊

Hedging is a market-neutral trading strategy that enables traders to profit from virtually any market conditions: uptrend, downtrend, or sideways movement. This strategy is categorized as a statistical arbitrage and convergence trading strategy.

### How It Works:

1. **Cointegration Analysis**: Identify cointegrated pairs of stocks within a specified time interval.
2. **Spread Calculation**: Calculate the spread of the cointegrated pairs using linear regression.
3. **Signal Generation**: Generate trading signals based on Z-score normalization.
   - Go "Long" the spread whenever the Z-score is below -1.0
   - Go "Short" the spread when the Z-score is above 1.0
   - Exit positions when the Z-score approaches zero
4. **Backtesting**: Test the strategy on historical data to evaluate performance.
5. **Portfolio Returns**: Calculate and analyze the returns of the portfolio based on the strategy.
