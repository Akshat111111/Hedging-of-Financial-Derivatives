    "## Market Adapter\n",
    "Exchange or any market data vendor sends data in their own format. Your algorithmic trading system may or may not understand that language. Exchange provides you with an API or an Application Program Interface ⁽²⁾ which allows you to program and create your own adapter which can convert the format of the data into a format that your system can understand.\n",
    "## Complex Event Processing Engine\n",
    "A complex event is a set of other events that together implies an occurrence of something of significance. These include stock trends, market movements, news etc. Complex event processing is performing computational operations on complex events in a short time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an automated trading system, the operations can include detecting complex patterns, building correlations, and relationships such as causality and timing between any incoming events.CEP systems process events in real-time, thus the faster the processing of events, the better a CEP system is. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CEP system comprises of four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CEP engine\n",
    "- CEP rules\n",

    "\n",
    "The majority of work is concentrated in CEP system block, formulating trading strategies; performing rigorous backtesting, optimization, and position-sizing among other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done to ensure the viability of the trading strategy in real markets. No single strategy can guarantee everlasting profits. Hence, quants are required to come up with new strategies on a regular basis to maintain an edge in the markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of popular automated trading systems that are classified as different strategies namely momentum strategies, statistical arbitrage, market making, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Order Routing System\n",
    "\n",
    "The order is encrypted in the language that the exchange can understand, using the APIs which are provided by the exchange. There are two kinds of APIs provided by the exchange: native API and FIX API. Native APIs are those which are specific to a certain exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://d1rwhvwstyk9gu.cloudfront.net/2023/01/Order-manager.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The FIX (Financial Information Exchange) protocol is a set of rules used across different exchanges to make the data flow in security markets easier and more effective. \n",

    "# Risk management in Automated Trading Systems\n",
    "Since automated trading systems work without any human intervention, it becomes pertinent to have thorough risk checks to ensure that the trading systems perform as designed. The absence of risk checks or faulty risk management can lead to enormous irrecoverable losses for a quantitative firm. Thus, a risk management system (RMS) forms a very critical component of any automated trading system.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 places where risk management is handled in automated trading systems:\n",
