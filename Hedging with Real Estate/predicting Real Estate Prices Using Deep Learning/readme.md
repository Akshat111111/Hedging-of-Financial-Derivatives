## Project Overview

Financial time series forecasting is a crucial aspect of financial analysis and trading. This project utilizes an LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict financial time series data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical financial data, which includes features such as timestamp, open, high, low, close prices, and volume.

Usage
Prepare the Data: Ensure your dataset is in the correct format and split into training and testing sets.
Train the Model: Run the training script to train the LSTM model on your data.
Evaluate the Model: Test the model's performance on the test set and visualize the results.

Results
The LSTM model was trained for 50 epochs. Below are the final results:

Training Loss: 1302982950912.0
Validation Loss: 1687186571264.0
Test Loss: 1299168362496.0
