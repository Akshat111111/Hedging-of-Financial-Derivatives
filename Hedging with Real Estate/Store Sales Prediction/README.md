# Store Sales Prediction using Deep Learning

## Goal
The goal of this project is to predict store sales using deep learning techniques, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and to compare their performance with traditional regression models such as Lasso, Ridge, and Decision Tree regression.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle competition: [Store Sales Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview).

## Description
This project utilizes RNNs to make predictions for store sales. The dataset is updated daily and is dynamic. The project also aims to compare the performance of various regression models, including Lasso, Ridge, and Decision Tree regression, with the RNN models.

## What I Have Done
1. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and used a correlation matrix to identify important features.
2. Tested basic machine learning models such as Ridge, Lasso, Linear, and Decision Tree Regression.
3. Tested RNNs, including multilayer networks for time-series data.
4. Found that RNNs are more useful and versatile for this task.
