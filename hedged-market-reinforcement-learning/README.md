# Reinforcement Learning for Market Hedging

This project implements reinforcement learning techniques for market hedging, aiming to maximize profit while minimizing losses based on market observations and sentiment analysis.

## Overview

The reinforcement learning algorithm used in this project makes decisions based on market observations and sentiment analysis to optimize trading strategies. The goal is to maximize profit and minimize losses in a hedged market environment.

## Components

### Agent

- The agent is the learner that makes decisions based on market observations and sentiment analysis.
- It interacts with the trading environment and takes actions to maximize rewards (profits) over time.

### Trading Environment

- The trading environment simulates the market conditions and provides observations to the agent.
- It receives actions from the agent and updates its state based on market dynamics.

### Sentiment Analysis

- Sentiment analysis is performed on social media data to gauge market sentiment.
- The sentiment scores are used as additional inputs to the agent for decision making.

### Replay Memory

- Replay memory stores past experiences (state, action, reward, next state) for training the agent.
- It helps in stabilizing and improving the learning process by randomly sampling experiences for training.

## Usage

1. **Initialize Environment:** Set up the trading environment with relevant market data and sentiment analysis inputs.

2. **Train Agent:** Train the reinforcement learning agent using historical market data and sentiment analysis. Use techniques such as replay memory and target model updating for stable training.

3. **Evaluate Performance:** Evaluate the performance of the trained agent on unseen data to assess its effectiveness in maximizing profit and minimizing losses.
