# Real Estate Data Visualization

This project provides a simple interface for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real estate dataset. The interface, built using Gradio, allows users to visualize property prices through bar plots and view basic EDA summaries.

## Features

- Load and filter real estate data based on maximum price.
- Visualize average property prices by locality using bar plots.
- Display basic EDA summary statistics for the filtered data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - gradio

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-eda.git
cd real-estate-eda
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare the Dataset

Ensure the real estate data is saved in a CSV file named `real_estate_data.csv` in the same directory as the script. The CSV should have the following structure:

```csv
bhk,type,locality,area,price,price_unit,region,status,age
3,Apartment,Lak And Hanware The Residency Tower,685,2.50,Cr,Andheri West,Ready to move,New
2,Apartment,Radheya Sai Enclave Building No 2,640,52.51,L,Naigaon East,Under Construction,New
2,Apartment,Romell Serene,610,1.73,Cr,Borivali West,Under Construction,New
2,Apartment,Soundlines Codename Urban Rainforest,876,59.98,L,Panvel,Under Construction,New
2,Apartment,Origin Oriana,659,94.11,L,Mira Road East,Under Construction,New
```

### 4. Run the Script

Execute the script to start the Gradio interface:

```sh
python real_estate_eda.py
```

### 5. Access the Interface

After running the script, a link will be provided in the terminal. Open this link in your web browser to access the interface.

## Usage

1. **Enter the maximum price** you are interested in (in Lakhs).
2. **View the results**:
   - A bar plot showing the average property prices for localities where the prices are below the specified max price.
   - A textual summary of basic EDA statistics for the filtered dataset.

## Example

**Input**: Max Price (in L): 60

**Output**: 
- A bar plot showing average property prices for localities where the prices are below 60 L.
- A summary of basic EDA statistics for the filtered dataset.
