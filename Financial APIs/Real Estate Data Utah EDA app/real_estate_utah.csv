land,"This property is not far from the Utah/Nevada border South of Lucin and about 5 miles West of the Sun Tunnels. To arrive at the property you take Hwy 30 and turn South onto Pilot Mountain Road. About 7 miles you come on Coal Bank Springs Road and follow that for about 2.5 miles. The property is about .25 miles south of Coal Bank Springs Road. There is no road directly to the property but the topography of the area is gentle rolling hills so a 4wd vehicle should be able to drive right up to the property. Along Pilot Mountain Road you see several landmarks, including the Transcontinental Railroad Line, Lucin Pond, and the Sun Tunnels are about 5 miles East of the property. Vegetation on the property includes Sagebrush, Prairie Grass, Wildflowers and Cactus. In the area I have seen rabbits, squirrel, lizards, Elk, Antelope and Deer. The property has great views of the Mountains to the East and the Salt Flats to the south. There are some rock outcroppings on the property. Soil is mostly sandy. There are no visible structures close to the property. There was a farm just north of the Sun Tunnels. The Sun Tunnels is a large - scale art installation. It consists of 4 large concrete cylinders, arranged on the desert floor in a cross pattern, that align with the sunrise and sunset on the summer and winter solstices. In addition to the solar framing, each of the cylinders has smaller holes representing the Draco, Perseus, Columba, and Capricorn constellations. The four concrete tubes act as viewfinders framing precise images which bring the vast space of the desert back to human scale. This would be a great property for someone who wants to be close to the mountains for recreation or wants to live off grid. The nearest towns with partial services are Grouse Creek to the North, and Montello, Nevada to the West. Wendover, Nevada to the south is the nearest town with full services.

townhomes,"This is your opportunity to own a unique property and a piece of Cache Valley's history! The old Lewiston State Bank, originally built in the 1920s, was last purchased in June '23. The original Architect, Fred Hodgson also designed the Ray B. West building at USU and the Smithfield Library, both of which are included on the National Historic Registry. The bank is not currently on the Historic Registry but potentially could be. Restoration funding may be available if the design is approved through the Registry office. The bank is currently zoned for commercial use. Lewiston City Planning and Zoning has expressed willingness to accommodate a zoning change to mixed-use, multi-family, or single-family residential. Buyers will need to obtain a building permit, which is contracted through Hyde Park. The building was unoccupied for several decades with a disconnected roof drain, which resulted in substantial water damage. New beams to reinforce the roof and upstairs have been installed. Complete replacement of roof sheathing and membrane in November 2023. Also, a new roof drain has been installed which is temporarily being run/drained through an East window. The upstairs subfloor has been completely replaced. Structural engineering and a building permit will be needed before rebuilding the main floor and stairs. Most of the exterior walls have footings inside the building, which may be an option to build the support for a new floor. The East portion of the main floor (Director's room and bathroom) has not yet been removed. This area likely will need to be removed and rebuilt along with the rest of the main floor. Will need new plumbing, electrical, HVAC, insulation, etc. Currently has 1.5 allotted parking spaces, but Lewiston City has expressed willingness to arrange a long-term lease for additional parking. No overnight street parking in the winter. Is connected to a water meter. Camera work was inconclusive if the sewer is connected to the old septic tank or the city sewer system. There is a sewer line and manhole on the East side of the building. The roof drain will need to be reconnected to the stormwater drain, which has an opening along the north sidewalk. There is likely a line running on the East side of the building, which the neighbor to the South is also connected to for his roof drain. The power supply is nearby. It will come from the South/East. We have met with RMP and it could be run overhead or buried. Original blueprints will be provided to buyers. USU special collections also has original duplicates of all of Fred Hodgson's work, including the bank. Scans are included in the listing photos. Also photos of a proposed floor plan for a single-family residence. Can provide initial code analysis, completed by a licensed architect Dec. 2023 for occupancy change to a single-family residence. New lumber sitting in the bank is included with the purchase. Approximately 16' walls in the main lobby. Showings will only be available on Tuesdays March 12th, 19th, 26th, and April 9th from 1:00-2:00 PM. Please schedule showings, contractors, ect. during that time frame. Will need to use the ladders provided to access the upper level and roof. Use ladders at your own risk Some areas are open to a drop and there is a potential risk of falling. Please submit offers on or before April 12th, 9:00 pm with an acceptance deadline of April 15th 9:00pm. Only offers with a minimum of $1, 500 non-refundable earnest money will be accepted.

Gooseberry Creek offers excellent fly fishing for surprisingly large cutthroat and rainbow trout, which flourish in its cold and clear high-mountain waters. Fishing for larger trout can be found within walking distance of the ranch, in the well-stocked Gooseberry Reservoir located on National Forest land. The Skyline Ranch protects areas considered critical for elk calving, and the large resident elk herds that inhabit the ranch through late fall offer some of the best hunting opportunities for trophy elk in all of Central Utah. This area is also famous for its trophy mule deer hunting, largely due to the mountain range's jaw-dropping alpine aesthetics.",2003.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,131638320.0,2400.0,2.0,2018-05-31,9900000.0,for_sale

This one-of-a-kind 5-acre estate on Old Ranch Road is only minutes from skiing and endless outdoor recreation.

The home's golf simulator is so state of the art, not only does it have almost every course and tee's up the ball for you, the floor actually slants to adjust for pitch of your lie. Going back to the testament of the greener side of this home: Even before the sellers started their custom build, they were extremely conscious of all the materials that would go into building this home. While interviewing contractors, if they didn't have a non-toxic, low, or no VOC type of application, they weren't even considered for any part of the selection. It was important to them because they don't want themselves, their children, or any of their five lovely grandchildren breathing the chemicals that harm their immune systems. All of the reclaimed wood that was used in (the temperature and climate controlled) wine room and barn doors were tested for heavy metals like lead. The outside farmland hay, alfalfa, and bluegrass, grown for the horses, cows, and chickens have never been sprayed with any type of herbicide. The wells and water are tested yearly to ensure the highest level of purity, no heavy metals, and no arsenic. The sellers have gone one step further and put a UV light in the ventilation of the house and on the well, no chemicals have ever touched this property. Not only is this one of the coolest homes in the state with all the toys, bells, and whistles but delivered with nicer touches and finishes you'll find elsewhere. As you look through the pictures of this home, take a moment and think of the painstaking time and effort to ensure the harmony between purity, function, entertaining, playfulness and happiness this home shares.",2020.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,1.0,8.0,370696.0,10714.0,2.0,2018-05-31,14000000.0,for_sale

Three reservoirs (Jordanelle, Rockport, and Echo), Park City, the Uinta Mountains, golfing, running, fishing, hunting, and several ski resorts are located nearby.

single_family,"Must see to appreciate this well maintained 3200 sq/ft pioneer home located in the historically charming town of Leeds, where it sits proudly at the SW corner of Main and Center Streets. From its humble beginnings in the summer of 1881, when Willard McMullin completed the one room rock house with 18 inch stone walls and 9' ceiling, this home continued to expand and remained within the McMullin family until 2006.In 2007, the home was lovingly refurbished by its present owner who was able to enlarge and upgrade the home with modern conveniences whilst maintaining the pioneer dignity the home is well known for. Included in the upgrades, were an added Primary Retreat, new metal roof, soffits, carpet, tile, energy efficient windows with levorlor shades, hickory cabinetry, and quartz kitchen counters, reverse osmosis as well as increasing the home's power panel to 200 amps from the standard 100. 2019 found the home receiving a new microwave, range, double ovens, air conditioner, furnace, and hot water recirculating system. There are both 30 and 50 amp outlets as well as a concrete pad for your RV needs.

First there is the large root cellar that still has the original coal chute (screened off to keep the locals out of course). The service porch has hickory storage cabinets the entire length, while the kitchen and pantry both have ample storage of their own, and did I mention the attached two car garage?

Sometimes it's okay-favorite color, favorite movie, favorite dessert-but in other cases, like picking a favorite child (or at least saying it out loud) could land you in hot water. It gets even trickier to pick a favorite part of this terrific 2-story home in Eagle Mountain. Nestled on Folkstone Road, the location in this booming town might be your top reason to like it. The community comes with bragging rights; it's young and vibrant and has loads to offer with schools, shopping, recreation, and exciting growth.

There's no weekend to-do list, as the home is nearly brand new, and only lightly lived in, and fully landscaped. We hear all the time that people want a house that's easy to maintain and with a layout that makes sense. Here you have that; the upstairs finds 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and the laundry room. Downstairs is your open canvas a second family room, game room, wet bar, extra bedroom or bathroom? The choice is yours. We couldn't pick our favorite part of this house any more than we can choose between inhaling or exhaling, but there are several contenders on the list to consider. First, updates. The gourmet kitchen, custom finishes, and updated fixtures throughout are stunning. Second, that main floor. Whether it's Sunday brunch, a casual party, or getting together with the gang from the good ol' days, the kitchen and family room open up to a concrete patio in the backyard (hello, less yard work!). Another possible fave? We're eyeing that covered pergola and hot tub area out back because nothing shouts summer more than the ability to spend evenings out in that fresh summer air.

single_family,"Remember that feeling growing up when you'd visit a beloved family member or friend? The anticipation of the drive there, the joy of pulling in the driveway, and how you knew you'd be welcomed with warmth the moment you walked in? It was a special kind of magic. Well, this SunCrest home has some of that same magic. The road here is just as peaceful, like those familiar childhood drives. By the pin drop on the map, you already know this is a special space in the SunCrest community, which sits high above the valley at over 6, 000 feet in elevation and sits amongst Gambel Oak with both mountain and valley views. When you get out of the car, that fresh air feels reminiscent of those days escaping the bustle of everyday life. This custom-built home is definitely going to spoil you. The views alone are incredibly indulgent, with an embarrassment of riches from Lone Peak, Box Elder, Mt. Timpanogos, and the Traverse Mountain range. Windows (and plenty of them) are placed thoughtfully throughout. Simply put, this home is drenched in natural light. Living here, it's like your own personal slice of paradise, sitting pretty on .32 acres surrounded by natural vegetation and thoughtful landscaping for the serene mountain setting. Step inside, and you're hit with an instant sense of comfort and ease. Built in 2003, the home has tasteful updates. The refreshed kitchen flows into the family room, making it the perfect spot for hanging out and making memories or soaking up those incredible views. The main floor also offers an office, half bathroom, a guest bedroom and bathroom, the laundry, and the home's primary suite. Be sure to imagine yourself here it was designed to maximize the SunCrest lifestyle. The lower level is wide open to those views, doubling your enjoyment of the outdoor lifestyle. A full kitchen and walkout mean you can entertain with ease, creating a space full of laughter and warmth. Three other bedrooms, two full bathrooms, and a wide-open family room that includes a home theater, complete the home's lower level. Here's the deal, folks: it's not just about the house. It's about the vibe, the community, and the people. The clubhouse is a short walk away and it's got it all pool, fitness center, and HOA shindigs.

You just need a septic tank and propane tank. The second is that you are in a beautiful location in the mountains with so many aspens that you won't be able to keep count. Up the road you can get a 360 view of the mountains around you and a picture of Scofield Reservoir (which is only about 30 minutes from this location). The third is the privacy. Since this is a summer cabin area, it is so peaceful and quiet where not many people currently live. You can ride your dirt bikes, ATVs, you name it. With it being only a 40-minute drive to Spanish Fork, you can take a weekend getaway whenever you want. It may be difficult to drive to if there is a lot of snow on the ground.
