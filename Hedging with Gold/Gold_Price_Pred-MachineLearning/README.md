## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for gold prices using historical data. Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated to identify the best performing model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle and contains historical data on gold prices along with related financial indicators.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the EDA phase, the following steps were performed:

1. Data cleaning and handling missing values.
2. Descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of data.
3. Visualizations to identify trends, seasonality, and correlations.

## Feature Engineering

The following feature engineering steps were applied to enhance the dataset:

1. Creating lag features to capture the temporal dependencies.
2. Generating rolling statistics (e.g., moving averages).

## Models Used

Several machine learning models were used to predict gold prices:

1. Random Forest Regressor
2. XGBoost
3. Decision Trees
4. Linear Regression
5. Gradient Boosting Regressor

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the models using techniques such as Grid Search. Key hyperparameters for each model were fine-tuned to achieve the best performance.

## Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R²)

## Conclusion

The project successfully developed a predictive model for gold prices. `XGBoost Regressor` was identified as the best performing model, achieving the lowest error rates and highest R² score.

## Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
