## Objective
Enhance credit risk models using Genetic Algorithms (GA).

## Description
This project uses Genetic Algorithms to optimize the parameters of credit risk models, improving their predictive accuracy.

## Steps
1. Collect and preprocess credit risk data.
2. Define model parameters for optimization.
3. Initialize a population of risk models.
4. Evaluate the fitness of each model based on predictive performance metrics.
5. Select the best-performing models.
6. Apply crossover and mutation to generate new models.
7. Repeat the process for a defined number of generations.

##Requirements
1. Python
2. NumPy
3. Pandas
4. scikit-learn

##Usage
1. Collect and preprocess credit risk data.
2. Define the model parameters and GA settings.
3. Run the genetic algorithm to optimize the credit risk model.
4. Evaluate the performance of the optimized model on a test dataset.
